  abstract  = {Most cooling reservoirs in the U.S. employ a surface intake, but many could obtain improved performance (decreased intake temperature during summer) by using a submerged intake. Potential improvements were studied using mathematical hydrothermal modeling applied to five hypothetical reservoirs located in Augusta, Ga. For the base case reservoir-characterized by an average depth of 30 ft (9.1 m), surface area of 2,000 acres (809 ha), and areal loading of 0.99 MWt/acre-and a range of vertical mixing parameters, intake temperatures from Apr.-Oct. decreased by an average of 0.7-1.2F (0.4-0.7C) using a submerged intake as compared with a surface intake. For a range of assumed turbine performance curves and cost parameters, these temperatures yield estimated energy savings of 1,200,000-20,400,000 kWh annually and total, present valued, cost savings of $700,000-$11,600,000. Savings increase as the reservoir area and depth increase and vertical mixing decreases. In most cases, performance also improves with combined use of a surface and a submerged intake, with the former used during initial periods of the annual stratification cycle.},

  abstract = {Abstract Vertical borehole heat exchangers are used to couple heat pumps to the ground, which serves as a source or sink of heat. These ground source heat pump systems heat and cool buildings efficiently with low maintenance costs. Many heat transfer models use the mean of the inlet and outlet circulating fluid temperatures as an average temperature along the entire borehole length. In this paper a weighting factor for the inlet and outlet temperatures has been developed that can be combined with 1D radial models in order to account for the variations in temperature with depth. The proposed method gives more accurate results than the mean temperature approximation without requiring computationally intensive 3D models. The method has been verified with measured data from thermal response tests on boreholes with single and double U-tubes, as well pipe-in-pipe (coaxial) boreholes. On the other hand, the usual mean temperature approximation sometimes leads to significant errors and unphysical temperatures.},

  abstract = {A recently developed vertical borehole ground heat exchanger model that accounts for transit time effects and time-varying short-circuiting heat transfer has been validated against two multi-flow-rate thermal response tests (MFR-TRT). The MFR-TRT, when performed with a wide range of flow rates, results in significant changes in the borehole thermal resistance, the borehole internal thermal resistance, and the short-circuiting heat transfer between the two legs of a single U-tube. The model accounts for short-circuiting by an analytically computed weighting factor that is used to determine the mean fluid temperature. The weighting factor portion of the model can be readily utilized in other ground heat exchanger models that currently rely on a simple mean fluid temperature. Use of the weighting factor is shown to give significantly better estimations of entering and exiting fluid temperature than using the simple mean fluid temperature. The new model is also compared to an alternative approach - using an effective borehole thermal resistance. While both the effective borehole thermal resistance model and the weighting factor give quite good results a few hours after a step change in flow rate, the weighting factor model gives much better results in the first few hours after a step change in flow rate.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper introduces a new methodology for the generation of thermal response factors of geothermal bore fields using the concept of g-functions introduced by Eskilson. Boreholes are divided into segments to consider the variation of the heat extraction rates along the length of the boreholes and the analytical finite line source (FLS) solution is used to calculate the temperature variations at the wall of each borehole segment along the axial direction. The proposed methodology accounts for the time variation of the heat extraction rates among boreholes and along the length of individual boreholes to obtain a uniform borehole wall temperature equal for all boreholes in accordance with the original boundary conditions proposed by Eskilson. In addition, the methodology is generalized to account for boreholes of different lengths and buried depths. g-Functions calculated with the proposed methodology are compared to the numerical technique used by Eskilson to derive the g-functions for fields of 1 to 12 x 12 boreholes. The difference between the two models is within 5% for all studied bore fields, except for fields of boreholes located on a single row. The variation of the heat extraction rates of individual boreholes along their length as well as in time also showed good agreement with the numerical model. It is shown that using 12 borehole segments is adequate to calculate the g-functions in most practical cases. For instance, the error on the g-function of a 10 x 10 bore field calculated using 12 borehole segments is 2.2% after 20years and 4.7% at steady-state.},

  abstract = {Abstract The borehole thermal resistance - that is, the thermal resistance between the fluid in the U-tube and the borehole wall - is both a key performance characteristic of a closed-loop borehole ground heat exchanger and an important design parameter. Lower borehole thermal resistance leads to better system performance and/or lower total borehole length and possibly lower installation costs. Borehole thermal resistance may be determined using in situ thermal response testing, but for design purposes, it is important to be able to predict the borehole thermal resistance prior to installation. Due to the complexity of calculating it, numerous simplified methods have been proposed. This paper reviews published methods for calculating borehole thermal resistance for grouted boreholes with single U-tubes and compares their results against a rigorous analytical method. Another quantity that is particularly important for deep boreholes is the internal thermal resistance - that is, the thermal resistance between the upward-flowing and downward-flowing fluid paths in the borehole. Short-circuiting between the two legs has the effect of reducing the total heat transfer and can be quantified as an adjustment to the borehole thermal resistance, resulting in an effective borehole thermal resistance. A few simplified methods for calculating internal thermal resistance are compared against a rigorous analytical method. The simplified methods for calculating both borehole thermal resistance and internal thermal resistance are compared in parametric studies spanning the range of borehole diameters, pipe spacing, ground thermal conductivities and grout thermal conductivities found in practice. Many of the simplified methods work well with some combinations of parameters and poorly with others. The first-order multipole expressions are closed-form algebraic expressions that give results within 2% (for borehole thermal resistance) and 6% (for internal thermal resistance) over the entire range of parameters. This represents significantly better accuracy than any of the other simplified methods and, therefore, the first-order multipole algorithm is recommended for single U-tube applications when the tubes are symmetrically placed.},

Most models are based on step response of the heat transfer rate, and the superposition principle allows the final solution to be in the form of the convolution of these contributions. The step response is thus a very important tool. Some authors propose numerical tabulated values while others propose analytical solutions for purely radial problem as well as axisymmetric problems. In this paper we propose a new analytical model that yields results very similar to the tabulated numerical ones proposed in the literature. Analytical modeling offers better flexibility for a parameterized design.},

  year        = {2008},
  abstract    = {A buried pipe heat transfer model was developed and implemented within the EnergyPlus simulation program. A literature review revealed different solutions attempted for this problem, including analytic methods, finite difference solutions, and transfer function methods. Three separate models: a modified earth tube model, a fully radial finite difference model, and a mixed-coordinate finite difference model were tested against a robust verification model developed in Fluent. Fluent was used due to its ease of setting boundary conditions and developing a sufficient mesh. The earth tube model is currently implemented in EnergyPlus, and was tested both as an earth tube and a pipe. The model's extreme simplicity led to poor tests upon verification. The radial model encountered significant stability problems due to the explicit formulation of the model. The mixed-coordinate model proved the most stable and accurate of the finite difference models. Although transfer function methods were investigated, they were not selected due to convergence problems in thick soil. In addition to verification against the Fluent model, the models were tested under high flow rate testing which removes axial heat transfer, and constant pipe wall testing. After implementation and testing in VBA, the mixed-coordinate system model was selected for implementation in EnergyPlus. This model utilizes a radial coordinate system in the near pipe region, with a coarse Cartesian system throughout the rest of the domain. The finite difference equations are implicitly derived. At each cross section, 2D heat transfer is modeled, neglecting axial heat transfer. The far-field boundary is a function of time of year and ground depth based on known surface temperature data. The initial implementation in VBA agreed to the verification model with an annual RMS error of 1.72C on the exiting fluid temperature. The final implementation in EnergyPlus agreed to the VBA implementation to within 0.12C. This small deviation is related to the time step management difference between the two implementations. This model is currently implemented in the plant manager of EnergyPlus, and is available to better predict heat gains and losses in the ground for all buried pipes.},

The method determines at each time step the heat transfer rates occurring at each borehole so as to reproduce the fluid temperature at the GHE inlet for a specific borehole arrangement. The analytical finite line source model is used to compute the borehole wall temperatures, whereas the fluid temperatures are assumed to vary linearly along the pipes. The method requires to solve a linear system of equations at a small number of time steps. The different systems of equations for each arrangement are determined. A comprehensive 3D finite element numerical model shows good agreement with the computed fluid temperatures. The proposed approach is computationally very efficient. The fluid temperature unit response function can be convolved with any desired heat load to estimate fluid temperatures at the GHE inlet for a wide variety of scenarios.},

  abstract  = {The article: A small but growing number of data centers are slashing their cooling costs by using the environment as their chiller, tapping nearby rivers, underground lakes, wells and even the Baltic Sea. A new project in Norway plans to draw cold water from an adjacent fjord and use it to cool data halls.The Green Mountain Data Center is located on the shores of the island of Rennesoy, inside concrete buildings within caves carved out of the mountain. Racks of servers will now fill underground halls that once stored ammunition for NATO.The project is being developed by the investment arm of the Norwegian shipping firm Smedvig, which is working with a leading Nordic IT services firm, ErgoGroup, and electric utility Lyse Energi.The ability to use the fjord as a low-cost source for chilled water was a major advantage of the Rennesoy location. Green Mountain's cooling system taps the fjord for a steady supply of water at 8 degrees C (46F), which is optimal for use in data center cooling systems.Chilled water is a key component of many data center cooling systems. This water is often supplied by chillers, large refrigeration units that require a hefty amount of electricity to operate. Eliminating the chillers will usually allow a data center to operate with lower energy bills than similar facilities using chillers.The Green Mountain Data Center is being built out in two phases. The first phase is designed for traditional colocation space, and will include about 7,000 square meters (about 75,000 square feet) of data center space. Another 4,000  square meters (43,000 square feet) will house data center container solutions, which will also use chilled water for cooling.The developers are in the late stages of negotiations with Norwegian clients, but believe the facility may be attractive to multi-nationals based in the U.S. and Europe. ``We are now mainly focusing on corporate customers with worldwide facilities who wish to reduce their carbon footprint across their portfolio of data centres, improve their `green credentials' and reduce spending on power,'' said Jonathan Evans of Green Mountain.The build-out of the colocation halls will begin in January, and the power to the facility is also being upgraded. Green Mountain expects the first clients to be installed in late 2012. Here's a video providing a conceptual overview of the project.},

  abstract     = {Field investigations in the hydrologic sciences often are limited by the ability to collect data at the high spatiotemporal resolution necessary to build accurate predictive models or to control complex engineered systems in real time. Here, we describe LakeNet, an embedded wireless sensor network constructed by an interdisciplinary team of hydrogeologists, environmental engineers, and electrical engineers at the University of Notre Dame. Off-the-shelf temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH probes are suspended from floating, waterproof cases with electronics, forming sensor pods. Wireless transmission to relay stations and a PC gateway enable researchers to interact with the network remotely to alter sampling patterns, download data, and analyze data trends using the gateway's recursive processing of raw data. LakeNet functions as a "smart" network, in which each pod is aware of surrounding pods. Ongoing research will allow in-network computation to detect change points in the data stream, thus triggering altered sampling strategy in response to sensed events or individual probe/pod failure. This ability for the sensor network to alter sampling strategy can increase sensor shelf life, which will become more important as novel sensors are developed, and decrease system energy requirements. Initial deployment at St. Mary's Lake on the Notre Dame campus in the fall of 2005 showed that temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen changes were consistent with diurnal fluctuations in sunlight, hence,
    photosynthesis. In describing LakeNet, we summarize current capabilities and ongoing research, including some of the challenges that need to be overcome for further sensor network development, widespread deployment, and maximum usefulness.},

The measured thermophysical properties of in situ soil were used in the CFD model. The thermal performance of slinky heat exchangers for the horizontal-coupled GSHP system for different coil diameters and slinky interval distances was investigated using a validated 3D model. Results from a two month period of monitoring the performance of the GSHP system showed that the COP decreased with the running time. The average COP of the horizontal-coupled GSHP was 2.5. The numerical prediction showed that there was no significant difference in the specific heat extraction of the slinky heat exchanger at different coil diameters. However, the larger the diameter of coil, the higher the heat extraction per meter length of soil. The specific heat extraction also increased, but the heat extraction per meter length of soil decreased with the increase of coil central interval distance.},

A second series tested the performance of Slinky heat exchangers with a flowable backfill material. Two groups of Slinkys were tested during this phase. One group was installed with flowable fill in four trenches, including a 40-foot trench (500 feet of pipe), 80-foot trench (1000 feet of pipe), 99-foot trench (500 feet of pipe) and 100-foot trench (750 feet of pipe). The second configuration maintained the 99-foot flowable backfill trench, and with it a 40-foot and 99-foot trench from the first test series, along with a 250-foot U-bend in a 6 foot deep horizontal bore. A third series of tests was done using a controlled bench test apparatus on a 40 foot long Slinky with 500 feet of pipe.

  abstract  = {Horizontal ground heat exchangers have been widely used in many countries as the heat source for ground-source heat pump systems. When abundant land space is available for the installation of ground heat exchangers, the horizontal ground heat exchangers provide a cost-effective choice because the installation costs of horizontal ground heat exchangers are much lower than those of vertical ground heat exchangers. Slinky-coil horizontal ground heat exchangers, which are basically coiled ground heat exchangers, require less land space than conventional straight horizontal ground heat exchangers because of the higher installation density of heat exchange pipes per given area. However, at present, the slinky-coil horizontal ground heat exchangers tend to be over- or undersized because of the lack of an appropriate design method for them. In this research on the optimum design of slinky-coil horizontal ground heat exchangers, a commercial finite-element simulator, FEFLOW, was used to simulate the performance of slinky-coil horizontal ground heat exchangers taking into account the energy balance at the land surface. The accuracy of the developed simulation model was validated through history-matching calculations on the basis of the results of thermal response tests and a long-term air-conditioning test under various test conditions. In history matching, reasonable agreement was obtained between the measured and simulated values of the heat medium and ground temperatures, demonstrating the reliability of the developed numerical simulation model using FEFLOW.},

The main results pointed out the heat fluxes transferred to and from the ground and the efficiency of the system. The calculations were made with the CFD code Fluent and the simulations covered one year of system operation, both in summer and winter for typical climate conditions of the South of Italy. The most important parameter for the heat transfer performance of the system resulted the thermal conductivity of the ground around the heat exchanger and the optimal ground type was that with the highest thermal conductivity (3 W/m K in the cases analyzed in this work). The choice of the velocity of the heat transfer fluid inside the tubes was another key factor. The depth of installation of the horizontal ground heat exchangers did not play an important role on the system performance. The helical heat exchanger arrangement resulted as the best performing one.},

An important feature is the local thermal resistances between the heat carrier flow channels in the borehole and the surrounding ground. The counter-flow heat exchange between the pipes is also important, particularly for the axial temperature variation. These resistances can be represented by a thermal network between the pipes and the ground. The borehole thermal resistance is readily obtained from the network. A fairly intricate mathematical algorithm, the multipole method, to compute the temperature fields and, in particular, the thermal resistances is presented. This article focuses on the application of the model, leaving the detailed mathematics to a background report. The formulas and methodology required for any particular case are presented in detail. The multipole method gives a solution with very high, and easily verified, accuracy for the steady-state heat conduction in a region perpendicular to the borehole axis. It is fairly straightforward to implement the algorithm in any design software. The computational time requirements are negligible. },

The technique, referred to as "multiple load aggregation algorithm" (or MLAA), uses two major thermal history periods, referred to as "past" and "immediate." In addition, the MLAA accounts for thermal interference among boreholes by numerically solving the two-dimensional temperature field in the borefield. Results of a comparison between the MLAA and the duct storage (DST) model are presented. Several cases are examined with two different borefields and several load profiles. Results obtained for one- and ten-year simulations show that the MLAA is in very good agreement with the DST model. In the worst case, the maximum difference in fluid temperature is of the order of 2 K (3.6F). This level of precision is more than adequate to perform accurate hourly simulations of GCHP systems. },

Surface water heat pump systems can provide heating and/or cooling for buildings and district heating/cooling systems, using lake or seawater as their heat source/sink. These systems have been used from the 1940s, yet neither design guidelines nor energy calculation procedures have been developed. Under the right circumstances, direct surface water cooling systems can have remarkably high seasonal system coefficients of performance-as high as 25. Surface water heat pump systems can also have high seasonal system coefficients of performance; values as high as 4.2 for cooling and 4.0 for heating have been reported. The performance of both system types will depend heavily on the pumping/piping system design. This article reviews the available literature describing previously installed systems and the necessary components-intake devices, piping, pumps, heat exchangers, heat pumps and/or chillers, and outfall devices. },

Thermal response tests are used to measure the site-specific thermal conductivity and are also used to measure the thermal resistance of a borehole heat exchanger as installed. Thermal response tests are commonly used today for design of multiple borehole ground heat exchangers, where knowledge of the ground thermal properties can help avoid undersizing of ground heat exchangers, leading to poor system performance, and oversizing of ground heat exchangers, leading to overly costly systems. This review covers the development of the mathematical and numerical analysis procedures, development of the hardware and test procedures, and validation of the results. We take a historical perspective, going as far back as Lord Kelvin’s treatment of transient heat conduction problems in the 1880s, further development of which allowed analysis of conductivity measurements from transient needle probes by the 1950s. We focus on development of test rigs and test procedures in the 1980s and 1990s and validation of the measurements. More recent developments are covered throughout the review.},

  abstract = {Several models are available in literature to simulate ground heat exchangers. In this paper an approach based on electrical analogy is presented, for this reason named CaRM (CApacity Resistance Model). In some cases several information are needed during design: both the borehole and the surrounding ground are affected by thermal exchange. The model here presented allows to consider the fluid flow pattern along the classical vertical ground heat exchangers as a single U-tube, a double U-tube or coaxial pipes. Besides, ground temperature at different distances from borehole are calculated, taking into account also the thermal interference between more boreholes. Starting from the supply temperature to the heat exchanger, the outlet fluid temperature is calculated and the ground temperature in each node, step by step. The model has been validated by means of a commercial software based on the finite differences method. Further comparisons have been carried out against data from a ground thermal response test and from the survey of an office building equipped with a ground coupled heat pump and vertical double U-tube heat exchangers. The agreement of results validates the model here presented.},

  abstract = {A quasi-3D model is used as a response model to generate normalized transfer functions of a borehole heat exchanger model. A solution is achieved by convolving in the spectral domain the transfer function of a given node with an input function describing the temperature change of the fluid over time. To demonstrate the accuracy and validity of the method, three comparison scenarios are studied. These scenarios compare the temperatures of a reference numerical model, the temperatures measured in the scope of a laboratory experiment, and during a field thermal response test. It is shown that the combined use of a spectral method and response model provides, in a few seconds, a temperature solution whose error is below or comparable to the measurement's uncertainty.},

According to the modelling for the surrounding ground, the new approach for the inside of the borehole is based on electrical analogy. In this study the double U-tube ground heat exchanger is analyzed. The new model has been validated by means of a commercial software based on the finite elements method as well as measurements of ground response test, using a suitable plant system. In this last comparison, the contribution of the thermal capacitance of the circulating fluid is investigated, since it is frequently neglected in short time step simulations. In both cases, there is agreement between the CaRM results and data from numerical simulations and measurements as well.},

The two configurations were installed at a shallow depth and studied, since a depth limit is mandatory in some areas. When installed this way, the interaction between the ground surface and the ambient environment needs to be taken into account when the thermal behaviour of the ground heat exchangers is investigated.
A detailed numerical simulation tool was used to carry out this research. The problem of heat transfer was solved with an equivalent electrical circuit of thermal resistances and capacitances. This simulation tool was also used on a double U-tube heat exchanger in order to include axial heat conduction in the ground and the borehole.
The two borehole heat exchangers were analyzed over both long- and short-term periods; the thermal properties of the ground, energy loads and the axial effects of weather conditions were also taken into account. Finally, a reduction in the borehole length for the helical-shaped pipe was also assessed and compared with the performance of the double U-tube.},

It is illustrated that one spectral element is capable of producing results which are more accurate than those produced by 200 finite elements.Practical implications – The gained computational efficiency and accuracy will boost considerably the possibilities for more insight into geothermal analysis, which will improve the procedure for designing competitive energy extraction systems.Originality/value – The models are capable of calculating exactly the temperature distribution in all involved borehole heat exchanger components and their thermal interactions. },
