  abstract = {Most cooling reservoirs in the U.S. employ a surface intake, but many could obtain improved performance (decreased intake temperature during summer) by using a submerged intake. Potential improvements were studied using mathematical hydrothermal modeling applied to five hypothetical reservoirs located in Augusta, Ga. For the base case reservoir-characterized by an average depth of 30 ft (9.1 m), surface area of 2,000 acres (809 ha), and areal loading of 0.99 MWt/acre-and a range of vertical mixing parameters, intake temperatures from Apr.-Oct. decreased by an average of 0.7-1.2F (0.4-0.7C) using a submerged intake as compared with a surface intake. For a range of assumed turbine performance curves and cost parameters, these temperatures yield estimated energy savings of 1,200,000-20,400,000 kWh annually and total, present valued, cost savings of $700,000-$11,600,000. Savings increase as the reservoir area and depth increase and vertical mixing decreases. In most cases, performance also improves with combined use of a surface and a submerged intake, with the former used during initial periods of the annual stratification cycle.},

  abstract = {Abstract Vertical borehole heat exchangers are used to couple heat pumps to the ground, which serves as a source or sink of heat. These ground source heat pump systems heat and cool buildings efficiently with low maintenance costs. Many heat transfer models use the mean of the inlet and outlet circulating fluid temperatures as an average temperature along the entire borehole length. In this paper a weighting factor for the inlet and outlet temperatures has been developed that can be combined with 1D radial models in order to account for the variations in temperature with depth. The proposed method gives more accurate results than the mean temperature approximation without requiring computationally intensive 3D models. The method has been verified with measured data from thermal response tests on boreholes with single and double U-tubes, as well pipe-in-pipe (coaxial) boreholes. On the other hand, the usual mean temperature approximation sometimes leads to significant errors and unphysical temperatures.},

  abstract = {A recently developed vertical borehole ground heat exchanger model that accounts for transit time effects and time-varying short-circuiting heat transfer has been validated against two multi-flow-rate thermal response tests (MFR-TRT). The MFR-TRT, when performed with a wide range of flow rates, results in significant changes in the borehole thermal resistance, the borehole internal thermal resistance, and the short-circuiting heat transfer between the two legs of a single U-tube. The model accounts for short-circuiting by an analytically computed weighting factor that is used to determine the mean fluid temperature. The weighting factor portion of the model can be readily utilized in other ground heat exchanger models that currently rely on a simple mean fluid temperature. Use of the weighting factor is shown to give significantly better estimations of entering and exiting fluid temperature than using the simple mean fluid temperature. The new model is also compared to an alternative approach - using an effective borehole thermal resistance. While both the effective borehole thermal resistance model and the weighting factor give quite good results a few hours after a step change in flow rate, the weighting factor model gives much better results in the first few hours after a step change in flow rate.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper introduces a new methodology for the generation of thermal response factors of geothermal bore fields using the concept of g-functions introduced by Eskilson. Boreholes are divided into segments to consider the variation of the heat extraction rates along the length of the boreholes and the analytical finite line source (FLS) solution is used to calculate the temperature variations at the wall of each borehole segment along the axial direction. The proposed methodology accounts for the time variation of the heat extraction rates among boreholes and along the length of individual boreholes to obtain a uniform borehole wall temperature equal for all boreholes in accordance with the original boundary conditions proposed by Eskilson. In addition, the methodology is generalized to account for boreholes of different lengths and buried depths. g-Functions calculated with the proposed methodology are compared to the numerical technique used by Eskilson to derive the g-functions for fields of 1 to 12 x 12 boreholes. The difference between the two models is within 5% for all studied bore fields, except for fields of boreholes located on a single row. The variation of the heat extraction rates of individual boreholes along their length as well as in time also showed good agreement with the numerical model. It is shown that using 12 borehole segments is adequate to calculate the g-functions in most practical cases. For instance, the error on the g-function of a 10 x 10 bore field calculated using 12 borehole segments is 2.2% after 20years and 4.7% at steady-state.},

  abstract = {Abstract The borehole thermal resistance - that is, the thermal resistance between the fluid in the U-tube and the borehole wall - is both a key performance characteristic of a closed-loop borehole ground heat exchanger and an important design parameter. Lower borehole thermal resistance leads to better system performance and/or lower total borehole length and possibly lower installation costs. Borehole thermal resistance may be determined using in situ thermal response testing, but for design purposes, it is important to be able to predict the borehole thermal resistance prior to installation. Due to the complexity of calculating it, numerous simplified methods have been proposed. This paper reviews published methods for calculating borehole thermal resistance for grouted boreholes with single U-tubes and compares their results against a rigorous analytical method. Another quantity that is particularly important for deep boreholes is the internal thermal resistance - that is, the thermal resistance between the upward-flowing and downward-flowing fluid paths in the borehole. Short-circuiting between the two legs has the effect of reducing the total heat transfer and can be quantified as an adjustment to the borehole thermal resistance, resulting in an effective borehole thermal resistance. A few simplified methods for calculating internal thermal resistance are compared against a rigorous analytical method. The simplified methods for calculating both borehole thermal resistance and internal thermal resistance are compared in parametric studies spanning the range of borehole diameters, pipe spacing, ground thermal conductivities and grout thermal conductivities found in practice. Many of the simplified methods work well with some combinations of parameters and poorly with others. The first-order multipole expressions are closed-form algebraic expressions that give results within 2% (for borehole thermal resistance) and 6% (for internal thermal resistance) over the entire range of parameters. This represents significantly better accuracy than any of the other simplified methods and, therefore, the first-order multipole algorithm is recommended for single U-tube applications when the tubes are symmetrically placed.},

Most models are based on step response of the heat transfer rate, and the superposition principle allows the final solution to be in the form of the convolution of these contributions. The step response is thus a very important tool. Some authors propose numerical tabulated values while others propose analytical solutions for purely radial problem as well as axisymmetric problems. In this paper we propose a new analytical model that yields results very similar to the tabulated numerical ones proposed in the literature. Analytical modeling offers better flexibility for a parameterized design.},

  abstract = {A buried pipe heat transfer model was developed and implemented within the EnergyPlus simulation program. A literature review revealed different solutions attempted for this problem, including analytic methods, finite difference solutions, and transfer function methods. Three separate models: a modified earth tube model, a fully radial finite difference model, and a mixed-coordinate finite difference model were tested against a robust verification model developed in Fluent. Fluent was used due to its ease of setting boundary conditions and developing a sufficient mesh. The earth tube model is currently implemented in EnergyPlus, and was tested both as an earth tube and a pipe. The model's extreme simplicity led to poor tests upon verification. The radial model encountered significant stability problems due to the explicit formulation of the model. The mixed-coordinate model proved the most stable and accurate of the finite difference models. Although transfer function methods were investigated, they were not selected due to convergence problems in thick soil. In addition to verification against the Fluent model, the models were tested under high flow rate testing which removes axial heat transfer, and constant pipe wall testing. After implementation and testing in VBA, the mixed-coordinate system model was selected for implementation in EnergyPlus. This model utilizes a radial coordinate system in the near pipe region, with a coarse Cartesian system throughout the rest of the domain. The finite difference equations are implicitly derived. At each cross section, 2D heat transfer is modeled, neglecting axial heat transfer. The far-field boundary is a function of time of year and ground depth based on known surface temperature data. The initial implementation in VBA agreed to the verification model with an annual RMS error of 1.72C on the exiting fluid temperature. The final implementation in EnergyPlus agreed to the VBA implementation to within 0.12C. This small deviation is related to the time step management difference between the two implementations. This model is currently implemented in the plant manager of EnergyPlus, and is available to better predict heat gains and losses in the ground for all buried pipes.},

The method determines at each time step the heat transfer rates occurring at each borehole so as to reproduce the fluid temperature at the GHE inlet for a specific borehole arrangement. The analytical finite line source model is used to compute the borehole wall temperatures, whereas the fluid temperatures are assumed to vary linearly along the pipes. The method requires to solve a linear system of equations at a small number of time steps. The different systems of equations for each arrangement are determined. A comprehensive 3D finite element numerical model shows good agreement with the computed fluid temperatures. The proposed approach is computationally very efficient. The fluid temperature unit response function can be convolved with any desired heat load to estimate fluid temperatures at the GHE inlet for a wide variety of scenarios.},

  abstract  = {The article: A small but growing number of data centers are slashing their cooling costs by using the environment as their chiller, tapping nearby rivers, underground lakes, wells and even the Baltic Sea. A new project in Norway plans to draw cold water from an adjacent fjord and use it to cool data halls.The Green Mountain Data Center is located on the shores of the island of Rennesoy, inside concrete buildings within caves carved out of the mountain. Racks of servers will now fill underground halls that once stored ammunition for NATO.The project is being developed by the investment arm of the Norwegian shipping firm Smedvig, which is working with a leading Nordic IT services firm, ErgoGroup, and electric utility Lyse Energi.The ability to use the fjord as a low-cost source for chilled water was a major advantage of the Rennesoy location. Green Mountain's cooling system taps the fjord for a steady supply of water at 8 degrees C (46F), which is optimal for use in data center cooling systems.Chilled water is a key component of many data center cooling systems. This water is often supplied by chillers, large refrigeration units that require a hefty amount of electricity to operate. Eliminating the chillers will usually allow a data center to operate with lower energy bills than similar facilities using chillers.The Green Mountain Data Center is being built out in two phases. The first phase is designed for traditional colocation space, and will include about 7,000 square meters (about 75,000 square feet) of data center space. Another 4,000  square meters (43,000 square feet) will house data center container solutions, which will also use chilled water for cooling.The developers are in the late stages of negotiations with Norwegian clients, but believe the facility may be attractive to multi-nationals based in the U.S. and Europe. ``We are now mainly focusing on corporate customers with worldwide facilities who wish to reduce their carbon footprint across their portfolio of data centres, improve their `green credentials' and reduce spending on power,'' said Jonathan Evans of Green Mountain.The build-out of the colocation halls will begin in January, and the power to the facility is also being upgraded. Green Mountain expects the first clients to be installed in late 2012. Here's a video providing a conceptual overview of the project.},

  abstract = {Field investigations in the hydrologic sciences often are limited by the ability to collect data at the high spatiotemporal resolution necessary to build accurate predictive models or to control complex engineered systems in real time. Here, we describe LakeNet, an embedded wireless sensor network constructed by an interdisciplinary team of hydrogeologists, environmental engineers, and electrical engineers at the University of Notre Dame. Off-the-shelf temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH probes are suspended from floating, waterproof cases with electronics, forming sensor pods. Wireless transmission to relay stations and a PC gateway enable researchers to interact with the network remotely to alter sampling patterns, download data, and analyze data trends using the gateway's recursive processing of raw data. LakeNet functions as a "smart" network, in which each pod is aware of surrounding pods. Ongoing research will allow in-network computation to detect change points in the data stream, thus triggering altered sampling strategy in response to sensed events or individual probe/pod failure. This ability for the sensor network to alter sampling strategy can increase sensor shelf life, which will become more important as novel sensors are developed, and decrease system energy requirements. Initial deployment at St. Mary's Lake on the Notre Dame campus in the fall of 2005 showed that temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen changes were consistent with diurnal fluctuations in sunlight, hence,
    photosynthesis. In describing LakeNet, we summarize current capabilities and ongoing research, including some of the challenges that need to be overcome for further sensor network development, widespread deployment, and maximum usefulness.},

Experimental measurements of a horizontal-coupled slinky GSHP were undertaken in Talbot Cottage at Drayton St Leonard site, Oxfordshire, UK. The measured thermophysical properties of in situ soil were used in the CFD model. The thermal performance of slinky heat exchangers for the horizontal-coupled GSHP system for different coil diameters and slinky interval distances was investigated using a validated 3D model. Results from a two month period of monitoring the performance of the GSHP system showed that the COP decreased with the running time. The average COP of the horizontal-coupled GSHP was 2.5. The numerical prediction showed that there was no significant difference in the specific heat extraction of the slinky heat exchanger at different coil diameters. However, the larger the diameter of coil, the higher the heat extraction per meter length of soil. The specific heat extraction also increased, but the heat extraction per meter length of soil decreased with the increase of coil central interval distance.},

A second series tested the performance of Slinky heat exchangers with a flowable backfill material. Two groups of Slinkys were tested during this phase. One group was installed with flowable fill in four trenches, including a 40-foot trench (500 feet of pipe), 80-foot trench (1000 feet of pipe), 99-foot trench (500 feet of pipe) and 100-foot trench (750 feet of pipe).

  abstract = {Horizontal ground heat exchangers have been widely used in many countries as the heat source for ground-source heat pump systems. When abundant land space is available for the installation of ground heat exchangers, the horizontal ground heat exchangers provide a cost-effective choice because the installation costs of horizontal ground heat exchangers are much lower than those of vertical ground heat exchangers. Slinky-coil horizontal ground heat exchangers, which are basically coiled ground heat exchangers, require less land space than conventional straight horizontal ground heat exchangers because of the higher installation density of heat exchange pipes per given area. However, at present, the slinky-coil horizontal ground heat exchangers tend to be over- or undersized because of the lack of an appropriate design method for them. In this research on the optimum design of slinky-coil horizontal ground heat exchangers, a commercial finite-element simulator, FEFLOW, was used to simulate the performance of slinky-coil horizontal ground heat exchangers taking into account the energy balance at the land surface. The accuracy of the developed simulation model was validated through history-matching calculations on the basis of the results of thermal response tests and a long-term air-conditioning test under various test conditions. In history matching, reasonable agreement was obtained between the measured and simulated values of the heat medium and ground temperatures, demonstrating the reliability of the developed numerical simulation model using FEFLOW.},

  abstract = {This work deals with the efficiency and the energy behavior of Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHPs) used for heating and cooling of buildings. In particular horizontal type heat exchangers have been investigated for different configurations, in order to evaluate the characteristics of these systems in the most common layouts and in different working conditions. The main results pointed out the heat fluxes transferred to and from the ground and the efficiency of the system. The calculations were made with the CFD code Fluent and the simulations covered one year of system operation, both in summer and winter for typical climate conditions of the South of Italy. The most important parameter for the heat transfer performance of the system resulted the thermal conductivity of the ground around the heat exchanger and the optimal ground type was that with the highest thermal conductivity (3 W/m K in the cases analyzed in this work). The choice of the velocity of the heat transfer fluid inside the tubes was another key factor. The depth of installation of the horizontal ground heat exchangers did not play an important role on the system performance. The helical heat exchanger arrangement resulted as the best performing one.},

  abstract  = {Ground-source heat pump systems use borehole heat exchangers to transfer heat to and from the ground. An important feature is the local thermal resistances between the heat carrier flow channels in the borehole and the surrounding ground. The counter-flow heat exchange between the pipes is also important, particularly for the axial temperature variation. These resistances can be represented by a thermal network between the pipes and the ground. The borehole thermal resistance is readily obtained from the network. A fairly intricate mathematical algorithm, the multipole method, to compute the temperature fields and, in particular, the thermal resistances is presented. This article focuses on the application of the model, leaving the detailed mathematics to a background report. The formulas and methodology required for any particular case are presented in detail. The multipole method gives a solution with very high, and easily verified, accuracy for the steady-state heat conduction in a region perpendicular to the borehole axis. It is fairly straightforward to implement the algorithm in any design software. The computational time requirements are negligible.},

The technique, referred to as "multiple load aggregation algorithm" (or MLAA), uses two major thermal history periods, referred to as "past" and "immediate." In addition, the MLAA accounts for thermal interference among boreholes by numerically solving the two-dimensional temperature field in the borefield. Results of a comparison between the MLAA and the duct storage (DST) model are presented. Several cases are examined with two different borefields and several load profiles. Results obtained for one- and ten-year simulations show that the MLAA is in very good agreement with the DST model. In the worst case, the maximum difference in fluid temperature is of the order of 2 K (3.6F). This level of precision is more than adequate to perform accurate hourly simulations of GCHP systems.},

Surface water heat pump systems can provide heating and/or cooling for buildings and district heating/cooling systems, using lake or seawater as their heat source/sink. These systems have been used from the 1940s, yet neither design guidelines nor energy calculation procedures have been developed. Under the right circumstances, direct surface water cooling systems can have remarkably high seasonal system coefficients of performance-as high as 25. Surface water heat pump systems can also have high seasonal system coefficients of performance; values as high as 4.2 for cooling and 4.0 for heating have been reported. The performance of both system types will depend heavily on the pumping/piping system design. This article reviews the available literature describing previously installed systems and the necessary components-intake devices, piping, pumps, heat exchangers, heat pumps and/or chillers, and outfall devices.},

  abstract = {When designing ground heat exchangers used with ground source heat pump systems, a critical design property is the thermal conductivity of the ground. Thermal response tests are used to measure the site-specific thermal conductivity and are also used to measure the thermal resistance of a borehole heat exchanger as installed. Thermal response tests are commonly used today for design of multiple borehole ground heat exchangers, where knowledge of the ground thermal properties can help avoid undersizing of ground heat exchangers, leading to poor system performance, and oversizing of ground heat exchangers, leading to overly costly systems. This review covers the development of the mathematical and numerical analysis procedures, development of the hardware and test procedures, and validation of the results. We take a historical perspective, going as far back as Lord Kelvin{\textquoteright}s treatment of transient heat conduction problems in the 1880s, further development of which allowed analysis of conductivity measurements from transient needle probes by the 1950s. We focus on development of test rigs and test procedures in the 1980s and 1990s and validation of the measurements. More recent developments are covered throughout the review.},

The model here presented allows to consider the fluid flow pattern along the classical vertical ground heat exchangers as a single U-tube, a double U-tube or coaxial pipes. Besides, ground temperature at different distances from borehole are calculated, taking into account also the thermal interference between more boreholes. Starting from the supply temperature to the heat exchanger, the outlet fluid temperature is calculated and the ground temperature in each node, step by step.

  abstract = {This paper makes a comparative analysis between a helical-shaped pipe and a double U-tube ground heat exchanger. The two configurations were installed at a shallow depth and studied, since a depth limit is mandatory in some areas. When installed this way, the interaction between the ground surface and the ambient environment needs to be taken into account when the thermal behavior of the ground heat exchangers is investigated.
A detailed numerical simulation tool was used to carry out this research. The problem of heat transfer was solved with an equivalent electrical circuit of thermal resistances and capacitances. This simulation tool was also used on a double U-tube heat exchanger in order to include axial heat conduction in the ground and the borehole.
The two borehole heat exchangers were analyzed over both long- and short-term periods; the thermal properties of the ground, energy loads and the axial effects of weather conditions were also taken into account. Finally, a reduction in the borehole length for the helical-shaped pipe was also assessed and compared with the performance of the double U-tube.},

  abstract  = {Common approaches to the simulation of borehole heat exchangers (BHEs) assume heat transfer in circulating fluid and grout to be in a quasi-steady state and ignore fluctuations in fluid temperature due to transport of the fluid around the loop. However, in domestic ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems, the heat pump and circulating pumps switch on and off during a given hour; therefore, the effect of the thermal mass of the circulating fluid and the dynamics of fluid transport through the loop has important implications for system design. This may also be important in commercial systems that are used intermittently. This article presents transient simulation of a domestic GSHP system with a single BHE using a dynamic three-dimensional (3D) numerical BHE model. The results show that delayed response associated with the transit of fluid along the pipe loop is of some significance in moderating swings in temperature during heat pump operation. In addition, when 3D effects are considered, a lower heat transfer rate is predicted during steady operations. These effects could be important when considering heat exchanger design and system control. The results will be used to develop refined two-dimensional models.},

Designed in the days of mainframe computers, expanding their capabilities further has become difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. At the same time, the 30 years have seen significant advances in analysis and computational methods and power --- providing an opportunity for significant improvement in these tools.
In 1996, a US federal agency began developing a new building energy simulation tool, EnergyPlus, building on development experience with two existing programs: DOE-2 and BLAST. EnergyPlus includes a number of innovative simulation features --- such as variable time steps, user-configurable modular systems that are integrated with a heat and mass balance-based zone simulation --- and input and output data structures tailored to facilitate third party module and interface development. Other planned simulation capabilities include multizone airflow, and electric power and solar thermal and photovoltaic simulation. Beta testing of EnergyPlus began in late 1999 and the first release is scheduled for early 2001.},

The model enables simulation of the initial transient behavior of a BHE and gives transparent insight into the heat transfer mechanism acting during the startup and operation of the BHE installation. To account for the thermal effect of natural convection that arises in non-grouted BHEs, the model is complemented with a Nusselt-correlation. The model is presented in detail in Holmberg et al. (2014) and in the present paper it is evaluated based on distributed temperature measurements from Acu{\~{n}}a (2010). The measurements were obtained during a distributed thermal response test (DTRT) and during heat pump operation, both on a 261m deep borehole equipped with a U-tube collector and a distributed temperature sensing system. Despite the simplifications involved with the model, it agrees well with the measured data even on a time scale on the order of minutes. The Nusselt number related to natural convection in the borehole was found to be 6.4 during the DTRT and 3.68 during heat pump operation. This indicates the large differences in the borehole thermal resistance during heat injection and heat extraction.},

  abstract = {Abstract Heat pumps (HPs) coupled to ground-loop heat exchangers (GLHEs) have become increasingly popular for heating and cooling purposes in the context of growing energy costs. Precise design of GLHEs requires the computation of hourly fluid and ground temperatures, especially when the geothermal system is coupled to another system (e.g. boiler, cooling tower). However, because of the computational burden, hourly computation is often simplified in actual designs by rules of thumb or approximations that can cause over- or under-design of the GLHE system. The hourly temperature computation can be seen as a convolution in the time domain that is most efficiently evaluated by fast Fourier transform (FFT). An additional substantial reduction in computing time is obtained by subsampling the analytical function at a few selected times according to a geometric sequence and then using a good quality interpolant such as the cubic spline. This combined {\textquotedblleft}FFT-S approach{\textquotedblright} enables one to obtain a 30-year hourly simulation in less than a second on a standard laptop computer, even for the computationally intensive finite line-source model. This reduction of one to two orders of magnitude in computing time compared to time-domain approaches with load aggregation should help promote the use of hourly temperature simulation for GLHE design purposes.},

Comparisons of accuracy, computation time and stability between the numerical solution methods revealed their advantages and disadvantages. While each solution method satisfactorily approximates slab heat loss, many methods exhibited stability issues or required substantially longer computation time. The method least affected by these two challenges was the alternating-direction implicit (ADI) method. Kiva features four approaches of initializing the soil temperatures for an annual simulation. A new accelerated initialization approach is shown to reduce the required years of pre-simulation. The combination of the ADI method and accelerated initialization reduces the total computation time by 95\% relative to the traditional implicit solutions.},

  abstract = {Abstract In most of the world, borehole heat exchangers used with closed-loop ground source heat pump systems are backfilled with a low permeability grout to prevent water contamination. However, in Scandinavian countries, a different approach is taken -- the borehole is sealed at the top and cased down to solid bedrock. The borehole then naturally fills with groundwater in the annular space between the U-tube and the borehole wall. Compared to grouted boreholes, the groundwater filling is advantageous in that it generally results in low borehole thermal resistance due to buoyancy-driven natural convection enhancing the heat transfer. Although this phenomena has been reported in several papers since the late 1980s, no calculation models have been available for use in either design tools or simulation programs. This paper presents experimental measurements from a single well-instrumented borehole under a range of heat transfer rates and annulus temperatures. Nusselt numbers for natural convection in the annulus are correlated against modified Rayleigh number. The results are verified by comparing to borehole thermal resistances predicted with the correlations to actual measurements from a range of boreholes in Sweden and Norway.},

Mass and heat balance problems are formulated for each component in the system and are assembled into system-level problems. A third problem is formulated to account for heat transfer in the bore field, using the finite line source solution. This third problem is coupled to the system-level heat balance problem by an analytical solution of the heat transfer inside boreholes with multiple U-tubes. The simulation model allows for any number of independent fluid loops within the bore field or within individual boreholes and allows for combinations of specified inlet fluid temperatures and heat extraction rates in independent fluid loops. The model accounts for the axial variation of the fluid and borehole wall temperatures and heat extraction rates. The capabilities of the model are demonstrated through three example simulations.},

  abstract  = {The interaction of buildings and ground source heat pump systems with the surrounding ground is quite important for design and energy calculation procedures. This article describes a one-dimensional finite volume numerical model that can be used to estimate the undisturbed ground temperatures under various ground covers---short grass, tall grass, bare soil, concrete, and asphalt; and a two-harmonic analytical model, which requires minimum computational time and is intended for engineering application. The analytical model relies on five model parameters: annual average ground temperature, two temperature amplitudes, and two phase lags to estimate the ground temperatures. The parameters are estimated using the numerical model results. This article presents experimental validations of both models: Nineteen geographically and climatically diverse measurement sites, covered by short grass or tall grass, are chosen for validating the models for a 1-year period using weather data at the sites. Validation results show that both models satisfactorily predict the undisturbed ground temperatures for these sites; the mean root mean square errors of the numerical model at all sites are 1.3{$^{\circ}$}C--1.6{$^{\circ}$}C (2.3{$^{\circ}$}F--2.9{$^{\circ}$}F) at 5, 20, 50, and 100{~}cm depths; the mean root mean square errors of the analytical model at all sites are 1.4{$^{\circ}$}C--2.4{$^{\circ}$}C (2.5{$^{\circ}$}F--4.3{$^{\circ}$}F) at the four depths. In companion articles by Xing and Spitler (2017) and Xing et{~}al. (2017), the authors develop automatic procedures using the two models to generate a worldwide dataset of both typical year ground temperatures and design year ground temperatures.},

  abstract  = {Analyses of building heating and cooling load calculations and design of ground heat exchangers often require the undisturbed ground temperatures as inputs. In a companion article (Xing and Spitler 2017), a two-harmonic analytical model which is used for the estimations of undisturbed ground temperatures for engineering applications has been developed. This model relies on a second-order harmonic relationship and five weather-related constants---annual average ground temperature, two temperature amplitudes, and two phase lags to predict the ground temperatures. These parameters are estimated using temperature results calculated from the numerical method developed by Xing and Spitler (2017). The two-harmonic model is validated using measured ground temperature data at 19 sites in the United States; these sites are located in three different climates---arid climates, warm climates, and snow climates. The model is convenient and provides with good accuracy. It relies on inputs such as soil diffusivity, vegetation density, and snow depth to estimate the ground temperatures; these inputs vary from site to site or vary with time. In order to generate typical year ground temperatures for thousands of sites over a worldwide range, the method described in Xing and Spitler (2017) needs some automated procedures to estimate these inputs for each site. These procedures are developed and described in this article. The two-harmonic model estimated typical year ground temperatures was compared to the experimental results at the 19 sites in the United States to validate the automated procedures. The validated procedures and model are applied for estimating typical year ground temperatures over a worldwide range for engineering application (Xing et{~}al. 2017).},

  abstract  = {Undisturbed ground temperatures are often required for engineering applications, such as analyses of building heating and cooling load calculations and design of ground heat exchangers. In two companion articles, an automated procedure for generating a world-wide dataset of typical year ground temperatures has been developed and validated against measured results at 19 Soil Climate Analysis Network sites. This procedure relies on a two-harmonic relationship and five weather-related constants---annual average ground temperature, two temperature amplitudes, and two phase lags---to predict the undisturbed ground temperatures. These constant values generated for 4092 sites world-wide covered by short and tall grass are summarized in Appendix A and B in this article. In the United States, a one-harmonic model which relies on three constant values to estimate the ground temperatures is commonly used. The ASHRAE Handbook and ASHRAE District Heating Guide provide these constant values in North America and in a world-wide range, respectively. The estimated typical year ground temperatures using the Xing and Spitler procedure are compared to the measured results at the 19 Soil Climate Analysis Network sites, it shows the mean root mean square errors of all sites are within 1.3{$^{\circ}$}C--1.6{$^{\circ}$}C (2.3{$^{\circ}$}F--2.9{$^{\circ}$}F) at 5--100{~}cm (2--40$\prime\prime$) depths, which are 0.7{$^{\circ}$}C--1.4{$^{\circ}$}C (1.3{$^{\circ}$}F--2.5{$^{\circ}$}F) lower than the root mean square errors given by the commonly used procedures in United States. Estimations of the peak (maximum/minimum) ground temperature over multiple years are also important. Thus, a correction factor $\beta$ is introduced in the two-harmonic model, the newly developed simplified design model could now be used to predict typical year ground temperatures and peak ground temperatures of multiple years. For a typical year, the correction factor is set to be 1. It is suggested that the correction factor of 1.6 to be chosen, so as to use the simplified design model to estimated maximum/minimum ground temperatures of multiple years.},

Two areas of active research are the development of models to predict the thermal performance of vertical boreholes and improved procedures for analysis of in situ thermal conductivity tests, commonly known as thermal response tests (TRT). Both the models and analysis procedures ultimately need to be validated by comparing them to actual borehole data sets. This paper describes reference data sets for researchers to test their borehole models. The data sets are from a large laboratory {\textquotedblleft}sandbox{\textquotedblright} containing a borehole with a U-tube. The tests are made under more controlled conditions than can be obtained in field tests. Thermal response tests on the borehole include temperature measurements on the borehole wall and within the surrounding soil, which are not usually available in field tests. The test data provide independent values of soil thermal conductivity and borehole thermal resistance for verifying borehole models and TRT analysis procedures. As an illustration, several borehole models are compared with one of the thermal response tests.},

The system energy performance of a monitored ground coupled heat pump system is calculated using the instantaneous measurements of temperature, flow and power consumption and these values are compared with the numerical predictions. These predictions are performed with the TRNSYS software tool following standard procedures taking the experimental thermal loads as input values. The main result of this work is that simulation results solely based on nominal heat pump capacities and performances overestimate the measured overall energy performance by a percentage between 15% and 20%. A sensitivity analysis of the simulation results to changes in percentage of its input parameters showed that the heat pump nominal coefficient of performance is the parameter that mostly affects the energy performance predictions. This analysis supports the idea that the discrepancies between experimental results and simulation outputs for this ground coupled system are mainly due to heat pump performance degradation for being used at partial load. An estimation of the impact of this effect in energy performance predictions reduces the discrepancies to values around 5%.},

Both a simulation-based design tool and the ASHRAE handbook design equation are used to find design lengths for four different real systems, using actual experimental data, including building loads as well as physical parameters as inputs. The measured minimum and maximum ground heat exchanger exiting fluid temperatures were used as the design constraint. The simulation-based design tool predicted the borehole length to within 6\% in all cases, while the ASHRAE handbook design equation yielded systems with errors from --21\% to 167\%. Most of this error can be explained by the way loads are represented in the ASHRAE handbook equation, with differences in the borehole thermal resistance also playing a smaller part. The ASHRAE handbook equation relies on a very simple load representation; although this allows it to be used as a simple hand calculation, it also precludes it achieving acceptable accuracy. It does not appear to be possible to revise the ASHRAE handbook equation so as to both significantly improve its accuracy and allow its use in a simple hand calculation.},

The execution of this experimental plant was completed at the end of year 2004, starting on February 2005 the regular operation of the air conditioning system. Since then, GeoCool facility has been monitored by a network of sensors characterizing its most relevant parameters. Several aspects of the performance and behavior of the system during its first operational year were presented on a previous paper. This paper presents the energy performance measurements of GeoCool ground coupled heat pump system acquired during five years of operation as well as the evolution of the return water temperature from the ground as a representative of the ground temperature. The analysis of the experimental results shows that the system energy performance is maintained through the years with no appreciable impact on ground thermal response.},

  abstract = {Ground Source Heat Pump systems can play an important role in reducing carbon emissions associated with building heating and cooling. The efficiencies and carbon emission savings achieved, partly depend on the optimization of the design, the control of the system and its reliability during extended operation. This paper reports the detailed investigation of the performance of a large system that includes fifty-six vertical borehole heat exchangers and four large heat pumps that provide both heating and cooling. High frequency data have been collected during the initial three years of operation that allow seasonal performance factors to be derived and detailed analysis of system operation. Annual performance has been found to be satisfactory overall but is highly variable depending on operating conditions and control system actions. A series of analyses have been carried out to investigate the roles of circulating pump energy, control system operation and dynamic behavior. A series of recommendations concerned with better design for part-load operation, reduction in pump energy demands and more robust control systems, are made with a view to improved system design and operation. Data from the study are being made available for further work on performance analysis and model validation studies.},

  abstract  = {Surface water heat pump systems utilize surface water bodies, such as lakes, reservoirs, and rivers, as heat sources and heat sinks. Closed-loop surface water heat pumps use submerged heat exchangers to extract or reject heat from the surface water body. Heat transfer between the heat exchanger and the lake is generally governed by buoyancy driven natural convection. One form of surface water heat exchanger is the spiral-helical heat exchanger, which is usually fabricated from high-density polyethylene tubing. Though the exterior convective resistance is an important part of the design calculation, convection correlations suitable for spiral-helical surface water heat exchangers are not available. In the current article, the authors cover an experimental study involving heat rejection experiments and heat extraction experiments on nine different spiral-helical configurations with three different high-density polyethylene tube sizes. Standard high-density polyethylene and thermally enhanced high-density polyethylene heat exchangers were also tested and compared.

  abstract = {The use of radiant technology in attics aims to reduce the radiation component of heat transfer between the attic floor and roof decks, gables, and eaves. Recently, it has been shown that EnergyPlus underestimates the savings using radiant technologies in attic spaces. The aim of this study is to understand why EnergyPlus underestimates the performance of radiant technologies and provide a solution strategy that works within the current capabilities of EnergyPlus. The analysis uses three attic energy models as a baseline for comparison for EnergyPlus. Potential reasons for the discrepancies between the attic specific energy models and EnergyPlus are isolated and individually tested. A solution strategy is proposed using the Energy Management System (EMS) capabilities within EnergyPlus. This solution strategy produces similar results to the other attic specific energy models. This paper shows that the current capabilities of EnergyPlus are sufficient to simulate radiant technologies in attics. The methodology showcased in this paper serves as a guide for engineers and researchers who would like to predict the performance radiant technology in attics using the whole building energy software, EnergyPlus.},

This enables the time delay produced by the fluid flow to be simply modeled in any time domain simulation. An optimal level of discretization, based on the residence time distribution produced by fully developed turbulent flow, is presented. The model is capable of calculating the response to changes in flow rate, fluid inlet temperature, and species concentration. The thermal response is based on a second-order model for each node, taking account of the thermal capacitance of the fluid and of the conduit inner wall. It is demonstrated that the model predicts a time delay, then a rapid initial response due to flow effects, followed by slower dynamics controlled by the thermal inertia of the walls. An intermodel comparison of output for a prototype duct is made with three published models, and an empirical validation is reported.},

Such effects have been shown to have an impact on peak temperatures and hence operation of heat pumps systems when short time scales are considered. A model has been developed that combines a two-dimensional numerical model and models of the pipe loop components. A novel heat exchanger analogy is employed to calculate the heat exchanger outlet temperatures such that iterative procedures can be avoided and numerical stability is unconditional. These approaches result in a model that is computationally efficient and captures much of the short timescale dynamic effects represented in fully three-dimensional models. This is demonstrated by comparison with experimental data and by comparing two and three-dimensional model behavior in the frequency domain. Predicted monthly outlet temperatures and heat transfer rates are furthermore shown to be in close agreement with experimental values and in good agreement with existing borehole heat exchanger models. The model is computationally efficient enough to allow use in routine analysis and design tasks.},

  abstract = {The modeling of the energy balance of buildings is a major task in building physics. In a new theory called dynamic thermal networks, developed at the Building Physics Research Group at Chalmers, the calculations are based on step- response functions, and the problems are illustrated in so-called dynamic networks. Long time scales for heat flux through building foundations and the surrounding ground are handled by a special reduction procedure.

The aim of this thesis is to apply the theory to increase knowledge of the factors that influence a dynamic heat loss calculation. The theory is used to illustrate the thermal behavior of different wall types, different foundations and whole buildings in three dimensions. The thermal behavior of a crawl space and an attic is studied, where the influence of long-wave radiation between internal surfaces is accounted for. A few applications of the theory on energy balances for problems having two or three boundary temperatures are presented, and an example of an application in a moisture problem is shown.

The step-response functions for one-dimensional cases are calculated analytically by using a combination of Fourier and Laplace techniques. The response functions for two- and three-dimensional cases are calculated numerically. Analytical expressions are fitted to the numerical values for short and long time to give better precision and faster calculation time.

The work reported in the thesis shows that it is fairly simple to apply the theory to heat balances. A building{\textquoteright}s heat balance can be calculated in a few minutes only for a time step of one hour during a year with an ordinary desktop computer. The full accuracy of the calculations for the three-dimensional step-response heat flow process in the building{\textquoteright}s envelope is essentially retained in the modeling during the annual cycle. The investigations of the thermal behavior of buildings and different building components show that a great deal of information can be gained from the response functions.},

  abstract  = {Despite the low energy consumption and lower maintenance benefits of ground-source heat pump (GSHP) systems, little work has been undertaken in detailed analysis and simulation of such systems. Long-term transient ground heat transfer significantly affects the performance of these systems. Annual and multi-year simulation consequently becomes an invaluable tool in the design of such systems---both in terms of calculating annual building loads and long-term ground thermal response. The EnergyPlus program, which makes use of variable time-step sizes in its simulation of building systems, was extended to allow multi-year simulations. Models of a water-source heat pump and a vertical borehole ground-loop heat exchanger have been implemented in Energy-Plus. The ground heat exchanger model uses Eskilson's {\textquotedblleft}g-functions{\textquotedblright} to model response to time-varying heat fluxes and has been extended to include a computationally efficient variable time-step load aggregation scheme. The performance of this model has been compared with an analytical line source approximation. For a steady periodic input that included pulsated heat extraction, the model agreed with the analytical solution to within 2{$^{\circ}$}C. The heat pump model was able to predict power and heat transfer rates over a wide range of operating conditions to within $\pm$10\% of published data. Experimental data from the Oklahoma State Hybrid Ground Source Heat Pump Laboratory have been used to validate both the heat pump and ground heat exchanger models. System simulation results were compared with five days of experimental data. The results showed an average error in the predicted ground heat transfer rate of less than 6\% and average errors in the predicted heat pump power and the predicted source-side heat transfer rate of less than 3\% and 4\%, respectively. Using these models, it is possible to represent GSHP systems in a flexible way and examine their performance over the extended periods required for proper analysis.},

  abstract = {The Drake Landing Solar Community in Okotoks, Alberta, Canada utilizes a solar thermal system with borehole seasonal storage to supply space heating to 52 detached energy-efficient homes through a district heating network. Systems of similar size and configuration have been constructed in Europe, however, this is the first system of this type designed to supply more than 90% of the space heating with solar energy and the first operating in such a cold climate (5200 degree C-days). Solar heat captured in 2293 m2 of flat-plate collectors, mounted on the roofs of detached garages, is stored in soil underground and later when needed for space heating, is extracted and distributed through a district system to each home in the subdivision. Independent solar domestic hot water systems installed on every house are designed to supply more than 50% of the water heating load. Annual greenhouse gas emission reductions from energy efficiency improvements and solar energy supply exceed 5 tonnes per house. The seasonal storage utilizes approximately 34,000 m3 of earth and a grid of 144 boreholes with single u-tube heat exchangers. The system is configured to maintain the centre of the field at the highest temperature to maximize heating capacity and the outer edges at the lowest temperature to minimize losses. A short -term thermal storage consisting of 240 m3 of water is used to interconnect the collection, distribution and seasonal heat storage subsystems. The system has undergone detailed monitoring since it was brought into service in July 2007 to characterize its performance and to improve the TRNSYS model employed in its design. A solar fraction of 97% in its fifth year of operation, convincingly confirms the design target, a solar fraction of more than 90% in year five, has been met. This paper describes the system and its operation, presents 5 years of measured performance and compares those results against the TRNSYS predicted performance for the same period.},

Heating and cooling loads are then converted into sine waves with an equivalent amplitude and the episodes determined from the change-point statistical analysis. Using the approximated equivalent sine waves, finite element or finite difference methods can be utilized to predict the long-term performance of the heat exchangers. The proposed methodology is compared to other existing approaches and showed better representation of the varying hourly ground thermal loads for a 1 year period. Moreover, a long-term thermal performance is predicted using the equivalent sine waves developed for balanced and unbalanced ground loads.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a finite line source model for vertical heat exchangers considering a layered soil profile. The existing analytical models assume a homogeneous soil profile, where the thermal properties of the ground along the entire length of the heat exchanger are uniform. This assumption can be unreliable since the typical length of heat exchangers is 60--100m (200--300ft.) and stratified ground is expected over this length. In the approach presented herein, the heat exchanger is divided into a number of segments to represent various soil layers along its length. Heat exchange induced temperature change at a certain location within the soil formation is evaluated by summing up the individual contributions of all these segments. The effect of the heat exchanger segment within the soil layer around itself is estimated using the finite line source model. Furthermore, the finite line source model is utilized on transformed sections for estimating the contributions of heat exchanger segments at locations outside their layer domains. The proposed model also incorporates two adjustments; the first accounts for the different heat rates within different soil layers while the second adjustment considers the heat exchange along the vertical direction between soil layers. Estimated results using the proposed model agree well with the results obtained from a calibrated finite element analysis. The proposed procedure is promising and can also be adapted within the framework of cylindrical models.},

New temperature response functions (G functions) are also presented for pile ground heat exchangers with spiral coils and for borehole ground heat exchangers with single or double U-shaped tubes. These temperature response functions can be used to analyze the impact of difference between properties of materials inside and outside boreholes or piles on the performance of ground heat exchangers. Theoretical results show that the difference in properties is an important factor affecting the temperature response of ground heat exchangers. Since the heat capacity of grout, inside boreholes, is fully considered by this line-source theory, the new G functions should be particularly suitable for predicting small-time dynamic behaviors of ground heat exchangers. Therefore, these G functions may be significant for energy analysis and in-situ thermal response tests of ground-coupled heat pump systems.},

In order to overcome this challenge, this paper develops an analytical full-scale model from the idea of matched asymptotic expansion. The full-scale model is a composite expression consisting of a composite-medium line-source solution (inner solution), a finite line-source solution (outer solution), and an infinite line-source solution. The full-scale model is first verified by a frequency-decomposition method. Furthermore, the full-scale model is reformulated as a multi-stage model based on Duhamel{\textquoteright}s theorem to reduce the computational cost. The multi-stage model combines the three separate solutions in a sequential way, i.e., the inner solution for the short-time scale, the conventional infinite line-source solution for the intermediate time scale, and the outer solution for the long-time scale. Finally, we perform a parametric study on a ground heat exchanger with single U-shaped tube, by which the spacing between U-tube legs, the length-to-radius ratio of borehole, the ratios of thermal diffusivities and conductivities of the ground and backfilling material are analyzed.},

The technique is suitable for modelling long-term thermal interactions, although it suffers from a lack of accuracy in the short term. Alternatively, models based on the theory of thermal resistances and capacities provide a more accurate solution for the short term but at the cost of a long solution time that prevents an efficient iterative use. In this work, an artificial neural network designed to rapidly and accurately construct the short-term g-function of a ground heat exchanger is presented. To assemble a large training set, 15 000 simulations are performed with an accurate thermal resistance and capacity model. The boundary conditions used to solve the model allow direct construction of the short-term g-function for the outlet fluid temperature. A multilayer perceptron architecture is proposed in conjunction with a methodology designed to reduce training time and increase the accuracy of the neural network. The output of the resulting network is compared with numerical and experimental data sets.

Due to more recent thermal networks incorporating meshing decentralised heat and cold sources, the system often has to deal with variable temperatures and mass flow rates, with flow reversal occurring more frequently. This paper presents the mathematical derivation and software implementation in Modelica of a thermo-hydraulic model for thermal networks that meets the above requirements and compares it to both experimental data and a commonly used model. Good correspondence between experimental data from a controlled test set-up and simulations using the presented model was found. Compared to measurement data from a real district heating network, the simulation results led to a larger error than in the controlled test set-up, but the general trend is still approximated closely and the model yields results similar to a pipe model from the Modelica Standard Library. However, the presented model simulates 1.7 (for low number of volumes) to 68 (for highly discretized pipes) times faster than a conventional model for a realistic test case. A working implementation of the presented model is made openly available within the IBPSA Modelica Library. The model is robust in the sense that grid size and time step do not need to be adapted to the flow rate, as is the case in finite volume models.},

The model includes a control strategy that regulates pressures of the fluid, thereby allowing the compression cycle to go from subcritical to transcritical for optimal heat rejection. The model can be used to simulate DX-GSHP systems under various loads and evaluate the effect of dynamic thermal behaviour of the ground on the system performance. The results show that there is a strong thermal short-circuiting within BHE when the system is operating at low mass flow, which hinders the system performance.},
