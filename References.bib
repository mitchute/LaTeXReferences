  abstract = {Most cooling reservoirs in the U.S. employ a surface intake, but many could obtain improved performance (decreased intake temperature during summer) by using a submerged intake. Potential improvements were studied using mathematical hydrothermal modeling applied to five hypothetical reservoirs located in Augusta, Ga. For the base case reservoir-characterized by an average depth of 30 ft (9.1 m), surface area of 2,000 acres (809 ha), and areal loading of 0.99 MWt/acre-and a range of vertical mixing parameters, intake temperatures from Apr.-Oct. decreased by an average of 0.7-1.2F (0.4-0.7C) using a submerged intake as compared with a surface intake. For a range of assumed turbine performance curves and cost parameters, these temperatures yield estimated energy savings of 1,200,000-20,400,000 kWh annually and total, present valued, cost savings of $700,000-$11,600,000. Savings increase as the reservoir area and depth increase and vertical mixing decreases. In most cases, performance also improves with combined use of a surface and a submerged intake, with the former used during initial periods of the annual stratification cycle.},

  abstract = {Abstract Vertical borehole heat exchangers are used to couple heat pumps to the ground, which serves as a source or sink of heat. These ground source heat pump systems heat and cool buildings efficiently with low maintenance costs. Many heat transfer models use the mean of the inlet and outlet circulating fluid temperatures as an average temperature along the entire borehole length. In this paper a weighting factor for the inlet and outlet temperatures has been developed that can be combined with 1D radial models in order to account for the variations in temperature with depth. The proposed method gives more accurate results than the mean temperature approximation without requiring computationally intensive 3D models. The method has been verified with measured data from thermal response tests on boreholes with single and double U-tubes, as well pipe-in-pipe (coaxial) boreholes. On the other hand, the usual mean temperature approximation sometimes leads to significant errors and unphysical temperatures.},

  abstract = {A recently developed vertical borehole ground heat exchanger model that accounts for transit time effects and time-varying short-circuiting heat transfer has been validated against two multi-flow-rate thermal response tests (MFR-TRT). The MFR-TRT, when performed with a wide range of flow rates, results in significant changes in the borehole thermal resistance, the borehole internal thermal resistance, and the short-circuiting heat transfer between the two legs of a single U-tube. The model accounts for short-circuiting by an analytically computed weighting factor that is used to determine the mean fluid temperature. The weighting factor portion of the model can be readily utilized in other ground heat exchanger models that currently rely on a simple mean fluid temperature. Use of the weighting factor is shown to give significantly better estimations of entering and exiting fluid temperature than using the simple mean fluid temperature. The new model is also compared to an alternative approach - using an effective borehole thermal resistance. While both the effective borehole thermal resistance model and the weighting factor give quite good results a few hours after a step change in flow rate, the weighting factor model gives much better results in the first few hours after a step change in flow rate.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper introduces a new methodology for the generation of thermal response factors of geothermal bore fields using the concept of g-functions introduced by Eskilson. Boreholes are divided into segments to consider the variation of the heat extraction rates along the length of the boreholes and the analytical finite line source (FLS) solution is used to calculate the temperature variations at the wall of each borehole segment along the axial direction. The proposed methodology accounts for the time variation of the heat extraction rates among boreholes and along the length of individual boreholes to obtain a uniform borehole wall temperature equal for all boreholes in accordance with the original boundary conditions proposed by Eskilson. In addition, the methodology is generalized to account for boreholes of different lengths and buried depths. g-Functions calculated with the proposed methodology are compared to the numerical technique used by Eskilson to derive the g-functions for fields of 1 to 12 x 12 boreholes. The difference between the two models is within 5% for all studied bore fields, except for fields of boreholes located on a single row. The variation of the heat extraction rates of individual boreholes along their length as well as in time also showed good agreement with the numerical model. It is shown that using 12 borehole segments is adequate to calculate the g-functions in most practical cases. For instance, the error on the g-function of a 10 x 10 bore field calculated using 12 borehole segments is 2.2% after 20years and 4.7% at steady-state.},

  abstract = {Abstract The borehole thermal resistance - that is, the thermal resistance between the fluid in the U-tube and the borehole wall - is both a key performance characteristic of a closed-loop borehole ground heat exchanger and an important design parameter. Lower borehole thermal resistance leads to better system performance and/or lower total borehole length and possibly lower installation costs. Borehole thermal resistance may be determined using in situ thermal response testing, but for design purposes, it is important to be able to predict the borehole thermal resistance prior to installation. Due to the complexity of calculating it, numerous simplified methods have been proposed. This paper reviews published methods for calculating borehole thermal resistance for grouted boreholes with single U-tubes and compares their results against a rigorous analytical method. Another quantity that is particularly important for deep boreholes is the internal thermal resistance - that is, the thermal resistance between the upward-flowing and downward-flowing fluid paths in the borehole. Short-circuiting between the two legs has the effect of reducing the total heat transfer and can be quantified as an adjustment to the borehole thermal resistance, resulting in an effective borehole thermal resistance. A few simplified methods for calculating internal thermal resistance are compared against a rigorous analytical method. The simplified methods for calculating both borehole thermal resistance and internal thermal resistance are compared in parametric studies spanning the range of borehole diameters, pipe spacing, ground thermal conductivities and grout thermal conductivities found in practice. Many of the simplified methods work well with some combinations of parameters and poorly with others. The first-order multipole expressions are closed-form algebraic expressions that give results within 2% (for borehole thermal resistance) and 6% (for internal thermal resistance) over the entire range of parameters. This represents significantly better accuracy than any of the other simplified methods and, therefore, the first-order multipole algorithm is recommended for single U-tube applications when the tubes are symmetrically placed.},

Most models are based on step response of the heat transfer rate, and the superposition principle allows the final solution to be in the form of the convolution of these contributions. The step response is thus a very important tool. Some authors propose numerical tabulated values while others propose analytical solutions for purely radial problem as well as axisymmetric problems. In this paper we propose a new analytical model that yields results very similar to the tabulated numerical ones proposed in the literature. Analytical modeling offers better flexibility for a parameterized design.},

  abstract = {A buried pipe heat transfer model was developed and implemented within the EnergyPlus simulation program. A literature review revealed different solutions attempted for this problem, including analytic methods, finite difference solutions, and transfer function methods. Three separate models: a modified earth tube model, a fully radial finite difference model, and a mixed-coordinate finite difference model were tested against a robust verification model developed in Fluent. Fluent was used due to its ease of setting boundary conditions and developing a sufficient mesh. The earth tube model is currently implemented in EnergyPlus, and was tested both as an earth tube and a pipe. The model's extreme simplicity led to poor tests upon verification. The radial model encountered significant stability problems due to the explicit formulation of the model. The mixed-coordinate model proved the most stable and accurate of the finite difference models. Although transfer function methods were investigated, they were not selected due to convergence problems in thick soil. In addition to verification against the Fluent model, the models were tested under high flow rate testing which removes axial heat transfer, and constant pipe wall testing. After implementation and testing in VBA, the mixed-coordinate system model was selected for implementation in EnergyPlus. This model utilizes a radial coordinate system in the near pipe region, with a coarse Cartesian system throughout the rest of the domain. The finite difference equations are implicitly derived. At each cross section, 2D heat transfer is modeled, neglecting axial heat transfer. The far-field boundary is a function of time of year and ground depth based on known surface temperature data. The initial implementation in VBA agreed to the verification model with an annual RMS error of 1.72C on the exiting fluid temperature. The final implementation in EnergyPlus agreed to the VBA implementation to within 0.12C. This small deviation is related to the time step management difference between the two implementations. This model is currently implemented in the plant manager of EnergyPlus, and is available to better predict heat gains and losses in the ground for all buried pipes.},

The method determines at each time step the heat transfer rates occurring at each borehole so as to reproduce the fluid temperature at the GHE inlet for a specific borehole arrangement. The analytical finite line source model is used to compute the borehole wall temperatures, whereas the fluid temperatures are assumed to vary linearly along the pipes. The method requires to solve a linear system of equations at a small number of time steps. The different systems of equations for each arrangement are determined. A comprehensive 3D finite element numerical model shows good agreement with the computed fluid temperatures. The proposed approach is computationally very efficient. The fluid temperature unit response function can be convolved with any desired heat load to estimate fluid temperatures at the GHE inlet for a wide variety of scenarios.},

  abstract  = {The article: A small but growing number of data centers are slashing their cooling costs by using the environment as their chiller, tapping nearby rivers, underground lakes, wells and even the Baltic Sea. A new project in Norway plans to draw cold water from an adjacent fjord and use it to cool data halls.The Green Mountain Data Center is located on the shores of the island of Rennesoy, inside concrete buildings within caves carved out of the mountain. Racks of servers will now fill underground halls that once stored ammunition for NATO.The project is being developed by the investment arm of the Norwegian shipping firm Smedvig, which is working with a leading Nordic IT services firm, ErgoGroup, and electric utility Lyse Energi.The ability to use the fjord as a low-cost source for chilled water was a major advantage of the Rennesoy location. Green Mountain's cooling system taps the fjord for a steady supply of water at 8 degrees C (46F), which is optimal for use in data center cooling systems.Chilled water is a key component of many data center cooling systems. This water is often supplied by chillers, large refrigeration units that require a hefty amount of electricity to operate. Eliminating the chillers will usually allow a data center to operate with lower energy bills than similar facilities using chillers.The Green Mountain Data Center is being built out in two phases. The first phase is designed for traditional colocation space, and will include about 7,000 square meters (about 75,000 square feet) of data center space. Another 4,000  square meters (43,000 square feet) will house data center container solutions, which will also use chilled water for cooling.The developers are in the late stages of negotiations with Norwegian clients, but believe the facility may be attractive to multi-nationals based in the U.S. and Europe. ``We are now mainly focusing on corporate customers with worldwide facilities who wish to reduce their carbon footprint across their portfolio of data centres, improve their `green credentials' and reduce spending on power,'' said Jonathan Evans of Green Mountain.The build-out of the colocation halls will begin in January, and the power to the facility is also being upgraded. Green Mountain expects the first clients to be installed in late 2012. Here's a video providing a conceptual overview of the project.},

  abstract = {Field investigations in the hydrologic sciences often are limited by the ability to collect data at the high spatiotemporal resolution necessary to build accurate predictive models or to control complex engineered systems in real time. Here, we describe LakeNet, an embedded wireless sensor network constructed by an interdisciplinary team of hydrogeologists, environmental engineers, and electrical engineers at the University of Notre Dame. Off-the-shelf temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH probes are suspended from floating, waterproof cases with electronics, forming sensor pods. Wireless transmission to relay stations and a PC gateway enable researchers to interact with the network remotely to alter sampling patterns, download data, and analyze data trends using the gateway's recursive processing of raw data. LakeNet functions as a "smart" network, in which each pod is aware of surrounding pods. Ongoing research will allow in-network computation to detect change points in the data stream, thus triggering altered sampling strategy in response to sensed events or individual probe/pod failure. This ability for the sensor network to alter sampling strategy can increase sensor shelf life, which will become more important as novel sensors are developed, and decrease system energy requirements. Initial deployment at St. Mary's Lake on the Notre Dame campus in the fall of 2005 showed that temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen changes were consistent with diurnal fluctuations in sunlight, hence,
    photosynthesis. In describing LakeNet, we summarize current capabilities and ongoing research, including some of the challenges that need to be overcome for further sensor network development, widespread deployment, and maximum usefulness.},

The measured thermophysical properties of in situ soil were used in the CFD model. The thermal performance of slinky heat exchangers for the horizontal-coupled GSHP system for different coil diameters and slinky interval distances was investigated using a validated 3D model. Results from a two month period of monitoring the performance of the GSHP system showed that the COP decreased with the running time. The average COP of the horizontal-coupled GSHP was 2.5. The numerical prediction showed that there was no significant difference in the specific heat extraction of the slinky heat exchanger at different coil diameters. However, the larger the diameter of coil, the higher the heat extraction per meter length of soil. The specific heat extraction also increased, but the heat extraction per meter length of soil decreased with the increase of coil central interval distance.},

The first tested relative performance of Slinky heat exchangers in spoils backfill with four different pipe arrangements, all with equivalent coil diameters and total feet of pipe, placed in trenches of various lengths. A second series tested the performance of Slinky heat exchangers with a flowable backfill material. Two groups of Slinkys were tested during this phase. One group was installed with flowable fill in four trenches, including a 40-foot trench (500 feet of pipe), 80-foot trench (1000 feet of pipe), 99-foot trench (500 feet of pipe) and 100-foot trench (750 feet of pipe). The second configuration maintained the 99-foot flowable backfill trench, and with it a 40-foot and 99-foot trench from the first test series, along with a 250-foot U-bend in a 6 foot deep horizontal bore. A third series of tests was done using a controlled bench test apparatus on a 40 foot long Slinky with 500 feet of pipe. This report discusses the data and presents a method for incorporating this information into Slinky heat exchanger designs.},

  abstract = {Horizontal ground heat exchangers have been widely used in many countries as the heat source for ground-source heat pump systems. When abundant land space is available for the installation of ground heat exchangers, the horizontal ground heat exchangers provide a cost-effective choice because the installation costs of horizontal ground heat exchangers are much lower than those of vertical ground heat exchangers. Slinky-coil horizontal ground heat exchangers, which are basically coiled ground heat exchangers, require less land space than conventional straight horizontal ground heat exchangers because of the higher installation density of heat exchange pipes per given area. However, at present, the slinky-coil horizontal ground heat exchangers tend to be over- or undersized because of the lack of an appropriate design method for them. In this research on the optimum design of slinky-coil horizontal ground heat exchangers, a commercial finite-element simulator, FEFLOW, was used to simulate the performance of slinky-coil horizontal ground heat exchangers taking into account the energy balance at the land surface. The accuracy of the developed simulation model was validated through history-matching calculations on the basis of the results of thermal response tests and a long-term air-conditioning test under various test conditions. In history matching, reasonable agreement was obtained between the measured and simulated values of the heat medium and ground temperatures, demonstrating the reliability of the developed numerical simulation model using FEFLOW.},

In particular horizontal type heat exchangers have been investigated for different configurations, in order to evaluate the characteristics of these systems in the most common layouts and in different working conditions. The main results pointed out the heat fluxes transferred to and from the ground and the efficiency of the system. The calculations were made with the CFD code Fluent and the simulations covered one year of system operation, both in summer and winter for typical climate conditions of the South of Italy. The most important parameter for the heat transfer performance of the system resulted the thermal conductivity of the ground around the heat exchanger and the optimal ground type was that with the highest thermal conductivity (3 W/m K in the cases analyzed in this work). The choice of the velocity of the heat transfer fluid inside the tubes was another key factor. The depth of installation of the horizontal ground heat exchangers did not play an important role on the system performance. The helical heat exchanger arrangement resulted as the best performing one.},

  abstract  = {Ground-source heat pump systems use borehole heat exchangers to transfer heat to and from the ground. An important feature is the local thermal resistances between the heat carrier flow channels in the borehole and the surrounding ground. The counter-flow heat exchange between the pipes is also important, particularly for the axial temperature variation. These resistances can be represented by a thermal network between the pipes and the ground. The borehole thermal resistance is readily obtained from the network. A fairly intricate mathematical algorithm, the multipole method, to compute the temperature fields and, in particular, the thermal resistances is presented. This article focuses on the application of the model, leaving the detailed mathematics to a background report. The formulas and methodology required for any particular case are presented in detail. The multipole method gives a solution with very high, and easily verified, accuracy for the steady-state heat conduction in a region perpendicular to the borehole axis. It is fairly straightforward to implement the algorithm in any design software. The computational time requirements are negligible.},

The technique, referred to as "multiple load aggregation algorithm" (or MLAA), uses two major thermal history periods, referred to as "past" and "immediate." In addition, the MLAA accounts for thermal interference among boreholes by numerically solving the two-dimensional temperature field in the borefield. Results of a comparison between the MLAA and the duct storage (DST) model are presented. Several cases are examined with two different borefields and several load profiles. Results obtained for one- and ten-year simulations show that the MLAA is in very good agreement with the DST model. In the worst case, the maximum difference in fluid temperature is of the order of 2 K (3.6F). This level of precision is more than adequate to perform accurate hourly simulations of GCHP systems.},

Surface water heat pump systems can provide heating and/or cooling for buildings and district heating/cooling systems, using lake or seawater as their heat source/sink. These systems have been used from the 1940s, yet neither design guidelines nor energy calculation procedures have been developed. Under the right circumstances, direct surface water cooling systems can have remarkably high seasonal system coefficients of performance-as high as 25. Surface water heat pump systems can also have high seasonal system coefficients of performance; values as high as 4.2 for cooling and 4.0 for heating have been reported. The performance of both system types will depend heavily on the pumping/piping system design. This article reviews the available literature describing previously installed systems and the necessary components-intake devices, piping, pumps, heat exchangers, heat pumps and/or chillers, and outfall devices.},

  abstract = {When designing ground heat exchangers used with ground source heat pump systems, a critical design property is the thermal conductivity of the ground. Thermal response tests are used to measure the site-specific thermal conductivity and are also used to measure the thermal resistance of a borehole heat exchanger as installed. Thermal response tests are commonly used today for design of multiple borehole ground heat exchangers, where knowledge of the ground thermal properties can help avoid undersizing of ground heat exchangers, leading to poor system performance, and oversizing of ground heat exchangers, leading to overly costly systems. This review covers the development of the mathematical and numerical analysis procedures, development of the hardware and test procedures, and validation of the results. We take a historical perspective, going as far back as Lord Kelvin{\textquoteright}s treatment of transient heat conduction problems in the 1880s, further development of which allowed analysis of conductivity measurements from transient needle probes by the 1950s. We focus on development of test rigs and test procedures in the 1980s and 1990s and validation of the measurements. More recent developments are covered throughout the review.},

This simulation tool was also used on a double U-tube heat exchanger in order to include axial heat conduction in the ground and the borehole.
The two borehole heat exchangers were analyzed over both long- and short-term periods; the thermal properties of the ground, energy loads and the axial effects of weather conditions were also taken into account.

It is illustrated that one spectral element is capable of producing results which are more accurate than those produced by 200 finite elements.Practical implications -- The gained computational efficiency and accuracy will boost considerably the possibilities for more insight into geothermal analysis, which will improve the procedure for designing competitive energy extraction systems.Originality/value -- The models are capable of calculating exactly the temperature distribution in all involved borehole heat exchanger components and their thermal interactions.},

  abstract  = {Common approaches to the simulation of borehole heat exchangers (BHEs) assume heat transfer in circulating fluid and grout to be in a quasi-steady state and ignore fluctuations in fluid temperature due to transport of the fluid around the loop. However, in domestic ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems, the heat pump and circulating pumps switch on and off during a given hour; therefore, the effect of the thermal mass of the circulating fluid and the dynamics of fluid transport through the loop has important implications for system design. This may also be important in commercial systems that are used intermittently. This article presents transient simulation of a domestic GSHP system with a single BHE using a dynamic three-dimensional (3D) numerical BHE model. The results show that delayed response associated with the transit of fluid along the pipe loop is of some significance in moderating swings in temperature during heat pump operation. In addition, when 3D effects are considered, a lower heat transfer rate is predicted during steady operations. These effects could be important when considering heat exchanger design and system control. The results will be used to develop refined two-dimensional models.},

For more than two decades, the US government supported development of two hourly building energy simulation programs, BLAST and DOE-2. Designed in the days of mainframe computers, expanding their capabilities further has become difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. At the same time, the 30 years have seen significant advances in analysis and computational methods and power --- providing an opportunity for significant improvement in these tools.
In 1996, a US federal agency began developing a new building energy simulation tool, EnergyPlus, building on development experience with two existing programs: DOE-2 and BLAST. EnergyPlus includes a number of innovative simulation features --- such as variable time steps, user-configurable modular systems that are integrated with a heat and mass balance-based zone simulation --- and input and output data structures tailored to facilitate third party module and interface development. Other planned simulation capabilities include multizone airflow, and electric power and solar thermal and photovoltaic simulation. Beta testing of EnergyPlus began in late 1999 and the first release is scheduled for early 2001.},

The model enables simulation of the initial transient behavior of a BHE and gives transparent insight into the heat transfer mechanism acting during the startup and operation of the BHE installation. To account for the thermal effect of natural convection that arises in non-grouted BHEs, the model is complemented with a Nusselt-correlation. The model is presented in detail in Holmberg et al. (2014) and in the present paper it is evaluated based on distributed temperature measurements from Acu{\~{n}}a (2010). The measurements were obtained during a distributed thermal response test (DTRT) and during heat pump operation, both on a 261m deep borehole equipped with a U-tube collector and a distributed temperature sensing system. Despite the simplifications involved with the model, it agrees well with the measured data even on a time scale on the order of minutes. The Nusselt number related to natural convection in the borehole was found to be 6.4 during the DTRT and 3.68 during heat pump operation. This indicates the large differences in the borehole thermal resistance during heat injection and heat extraction.},

  abstract = {Abstract Heat pumps (HPs) coupled to ground-loop heat exchangers (GLHEs) have become increasingly popular for heating and cooling purposes in the context of growing energy costs. Precise design of GLHEs requires the computation of hourly fluid and ground temperatures, especially when the geothermal system is coupled to another system (e.g. boiler, cooling tower). However, because of the computational burden, hourly computation is often simplified in actual designs by rules of thumb or approximations that can cause over- or under-design of the GLHE system. The hourly temperature computation can be seen as a convolution in the time domain that is most efficiently evaluated by fast Fourier transform (FFT). An additional substantial reduction in computing time is obtained by subsampling the analytical function at a few selected times according to a geometric sequence and then using a good quality interpolant such as the cubic spline. This combined {\textquotedblleft}FFT-S approach{\textquotedblright} enables one to obtain a 30-year hourly simulation in less than a second on a standard laptop computer, even for the computationally intensive finite line-source model. This reduction of one to two orders of magnitude in computing time compared to time-domain approaches with load aggregation should help promote the use of hourly temperature simulation for GLHE design purposes.},

Comparisons of accuracy, computation time and stability between the numerical solution methods revealed their advantages and disadvantages. While each solution method satisfactorily approximates slab heat loss, many methods exhibited stability issues or required substantially longer computation time. The method least affected by these two challenges was the alternating-direction implicit (ADI) method. Kiva features four approaches of initializing the soil temperatures for an annual simulation. A new accelerated initialization approach is shown to reduce the required years of pre-simulation. The combination of the ADI method and accelerated initialization reduces the total computation time by 95\% relative to the traditional implicit solutions.},

  abstract = {Abstract In most of the world, borehole heat exchangers used with closed-loop ground source heat pump systems are backfilled with a low permeability grout to prevent water contamination. However, in Scandinavian countries, a different approach is taken -- the borehole is sealed at the top and cased down to solid bedrock. The borehole then naturally fills with groundwater in the annular space between the U-tube and the borehole wall. Compared to grouted boreholes, the groundwater filling is advantageous in that it generally results in low borehole thermal resistance due to buoyancy-driven natural convection enhancing the heat transfer. Although this phenomena has been reported in several papers since the late 1980s, no calculation models have been available for use in either design tools or simulation programs. This paper presents experimental measurements from a single well-instrumented borehole under a range of heat transfer rates and annulus temperatures. Nusselt numbers for natural convection in the annulus are correlated against modified Rayleigh number. The results are verified by comparing to borehole thermal resistances predicted with the correlations to actual measurements from a range of boreholes in Sweden and Norway.},

Mass and heat balance problems are formulated for each component in the system and are assembled into system-level problems. A third problem is formulated to account for heat transfer in the bore field, using the finite line source solution. This third problem is coupled to the system-level heat balance problem by an analytical solution of the heat transfer inside boreholes with multiple U-tubes. The simulation model allows for any number of independent fluid loops within the bore field or within individual boreholes and allows for combinations of specified inlet fluid temperatures and heat extraction rates in independent fluid loops. The model accounts for the axial variation of the fluid and borehole wall temperatures and heat extraction rates. The capabilities of the model are demonstrated through three example simulations.},

  abstract  = {The interaction of buildings and ground source heat pump systems with the surrounding ground is quite important for design and energy calculation procedures. This article describes a one-dimensional finite volume numerical model that can be used to estimate the undisturbed ground temperatures under various ground covers---short grass, tall grass, bare soil, concrete, and asphalt; and a two-harmonic analytical model, which requires minimum computational time and is intended for engineering application. The analytical model relies on five model parameters: annual average ground temperature, two temperature amplitudes, and two phase lags to estimate the ground temperatures. The parameters are estimated using the numerical model results. This article presents experimental validations of both models: Nineteen geographically and climatically diverse measurement sites, covered by short grass or tall grass, are chosen for validating the models for a 1-year period using weather data at the sites. Validation results show that both models satisfactorily predict the undisturbed ground temperatures for these sites; the mean root mean square errors of the numerical model at all sites are 1.3{$^{\circ}$}C--1.6{$^{\circ}$}C (2.3{$^{\circ}$}F--2.9{$^{\circ}$}F) at 5, 20, 50, and 100{~}cm depths; the mean root mean square errors of the analytical model at all sites are 1.4{$^{\circ}$}C--2.4{$^{\circ}$}C (2.5{$^{\circ}$}F--4.3{$^{\circ}$}F) at the four depths. In companion articles by Xing and Spitler (2017) and Xing et{~}al. (2017), the authors develop automatic procedures using the two models to generate a worldwide dataset of both typical year ground temperatures and design year ground temperatures.},

  abstract  = {Analyses of building heating and cooling load calculations and design of ground heat exchangers often require the undisturbed ground temperatures as inputs. In a companion article (Xing and Spitler 2017), a two-harmonic analytical model which is used for the estimations of undisturbed ground temperatures for engineering applications has been developed. This model relies on a second-order harmonic relationship and five weather-related constants---annual average ground temperature, two temperature amplitudes, and two phase lags to predict the ground temperatures. These parameters are estimated using temperature results calculated from the numerical method developed by Xing and Spitler (2017). The two-harmonic model is validated using measured ground temperature data at 19 sites in the United States; these sites are located in three different climates---arid climates, warm climates, and snow climates. The model is convenient and provides with good accuracy. It relies on inputs such as soil diffusivity, vegetation density, and snow depth to estimate the ground temperatures; these inputs vary from site to site or vary with time. In order to generate typical year ground temperatures for thousands of sites over a worldwide range, the method described in Xing and Spitler (2017) needs some automated procedures to estimate these inputs for each site. These procedures are developed and described in this article. The two-harmonic model estimated typical year ground temperatures was compared to the experimental results at the 19 sites in the United States to validate the automated procedures. The validated procedures and model are applied for estimating typical year ground temperatures over a worldwide range for engineering application (Xing et{~}al. 2017).},

  abstract  = {Undisturbed ground temperatures are often required for engineering applications, such as analyses of building heating and cooling load calculations and design of ground heat exchangers. In two companion articles, an automated procedure for generating a world-wide dataset of typical year ground temperatures has been developed and validated against measured results at 19 Soil Climate Analysis Network sites. This procedure relies on a two-harmonic relationship and five weather-related constants---annual average ground temperature, two temperature amplitudes, and two phase lags---to predict the undisturbed ground temperatures. These constant values generated for 4092 sites world-wide covered by short and tall grass are summarized in Appendix A and B in this article. In the United States, a one-harmonic model which relies on three constant values to estimate the ground temperatures is commonly used. The ASHRAE Handbook and ASHRAE District Heating Guide provide these constant values in North America and in a world-wide range, respectively. The estimated typical year ground temperatures using the Xing and Spitler procedure are compared to the measured results at the 19 Soil Climate Analysis Network sites, it shows the mean root mean square errors of all sites are within 1.3{$^{\circ}$}C--1.6{$^{\circ}$}C (2.3{$^{\circ}$}F--2.9{$^{\circ}$}F) at 5--100{~}cm (2--40$\prime\prime$) depths, which are 0.7{$^{\circ}$}C--1.4{$^{\circ}$}C (1.3{$^{\circ}$}F--2.5{$^{\circ}$}F) lower than the root mean square errors given by the commonly used procedures in United States. Estimations of the peak (maximum/minimum) ground temperature over multiple years are also important. Thus, a correction factor $\beta$ is introduced in the two-harmonic model, the newly developed simplified design model could now be used to predict typical year ground temperatures and peak ground temperatures of multiple years. For a typical year, the correction factor is set to be 1. It is suggested that the correction factor of 1.6 to be chosen, so as to use the simplified design model to estimated maximum/minimum ground temperatures of multiple years.},

Two areas of active research are the development of models to predict the thermal performance of vertical boreholes and improved procedures for analysis of in situ thermal conductivity tests, commonly known as thermal response tests (TRT). Both the models and analysis procedures ultimately need to be validated by comparing them to actual borehole data sets. This paper describes reference data sets for researchers to test their borehole models. The data sets are from a large laboratory {\textquotedblleft}sandbox{\textquotedblright} containing a borehole with a U-tube. The tests are made under more controlled conditions than can be obtained in field tests. Thermal response tests on the borehole include temperature measurements on the borehole wall and within the surrounding soil, which are not usually available in field tests. The test data provide independent values of soil thermal conductivity and borehole thermal resistance for verifying borehole models and TRT analysis procedures. As an illustration, several borehole models are compared with one of the thermal response tests.},

The system energy performance of a monitored ground coupled heat pump system is calculated using the instantaneous measurements of temperature, flow and power consumption and these values are compared with the numerical predictions. These predictions are performed with the TRNSYS software tool following standard procedures taking the experimental thermal loads as input values. The main result of this work is that simulation results solely based on nominal heat pump capacities and performances overestimate the measured overall energy performance by a percentage between 15% and 20%. A sensitivity analysis of the simulation results to changes in percentage of its input parameters showed that the heat pump nominal coefficient of performance is the parameter that mostly affects the energy performance predictions. This analysis supports the idea that the discrepancies between experimental results and simulation outputs for this ground coupled system are mainly due to heat pump performance degradation for being used at partial load. An estimation of the impact of this effect in energy performance predictions reduces the discrepancies to values around 5%.},

Both a simulation-based design tool and the ASHRAE handbook design equation are used to find design lengths for four different real systems, using actual experimental data, including building loads as well as physical parameters as inputs. The measured minimum and maximum ground heat exchanger exiting fluid temperatures were used as the design constraint. The simulation-based design tool predicted the borehole length to within 6\% in all cases, while the ASHRAE handbook design equation yielded systems with errors from --21\% to 167\%. Most of this error can be explained by the way loads are represented in the ASHRAE handbook equation, with differences in the borehole thermal resistance also playing a smaller part. The ASHRAE handbook equation relies on a very simple load representation; although this allows it to be used as a simple hand calculation, it also precludes it achieving acceptable accuracy. It does not appear to be possible to revise the ASHRAE handbook equation so as to both significantly improve its accuracy and allow its use in a simple hand calculation.},

Since then, GeoCool facility has been monitored by a network of sensors characterizing its most relevant parameters. Several aspects of the performance and behavior of the system during its first operational year were presented on a previous paper. This paper presents the energy performance measurements of GeoCool ground coupled heat pump system acquired during five years of operation as well as the evolution of the return water temperature from the ground as a representative of the ground temperature. The analysis of the experimental results shows that the system energy performance is maintained through the years with no appreciable impact on ground thermal response.},

  abstract = {Ground Source Heat Pump systems can play an important role in reducing carbon emissions associated with building heating and cooling. The efficiencies and carbon emission savings achieved, partly depend on the optimization of the design, the control of the system and its reliability during extended operation. This paper reports the detailed investigation of the performance of a large system that includes fifty-six vertical borehole heat exchangers and four large heat pumps that provide both heating and cooling. High frequency data have been collected during the initial three years of operation that allow seasonal performance factors to be derived and detailed analysis of system operation. Annual performance has been found to be satisfactory overall but is highly variable depending on operating conditions and control system actions. A series of analyses have been carried out to investigate the roles of circulating pump energy, control system operation and dynamic behavior. A series of recommendations concerned with better design for part-load operation, reduction in pump energy demands and more robust control systems, are made with a view to improved system design and operation. Data from the study are being made available for further work on performance analysis and model validation studies.},

Closed-loop surface water heat pumps use submerged heat exchangers to extract or reject heat from the surface water body. Heat transfer between the heat exchanger and the lake is generally governed by buoyancy driven natural convection. One form of surface water heat exchanger is the spiral-helical heat exchanger, which is usually fabricated from high-density polyethylene tubing. Though the exterior convective resistance is an important part of the design calculation, convection correlations suitable for spiral-helical surface water heat exchangers are not available. In the current article, the authors cover an experimental study involving heat rejection experiments and heat extraction experiments on nine different spiral-helical configurations with three different high-density polyethylene tube sizes. Standard high-density polyethylene and thermally enhanced high-density polyethylene heat exchangers were also tested and compared. Convection correlations for spiral-helical heat exchangers were developed for heat extraction and heat rejection conditions. Heat transfer rate predicted with the correlations is compared against experimental data.},

Recently, it has been shown that EnergyPlus underestimates the savings using radiant technologies in attic spaces. The aim of this study is to understand why EnergyPlus underestimates the performance of radiant technologies and provide a solution strategy that works within the current capabilities of EnergyPlus. The analysis uses three attic energy models as a baseline for comparison for EnergyPlus. Potential reasons for the discrepancies between the attic specific energy models and EnergyPlus are isolated and individually tested. A solution strategy is proposed using the Energy Management System (EMS) capabilities within EnergyPlus. This solution strategy produces similar results to the other attic specific energy models. This paper shows that the current capabilities of EnergyPlus are sufficient to simulate radiant technologies in attics. The methodology showcased in this paper serves as a guide for engineers and researchers who would like to predict the performance radiant technology in attics using the whole building energy software, EnergyPlus.},

  abstract  = {A method for the dynamic modeling of a fluid conduit is developed, based on its discretization into a sequence of well-mixed flow nodes. This enables the time delay produced by the fluid flow to be simply modeled in any time domain simulation. An optimal level of discretization, based on the residence time distribution produced by fully developed turbulent flow, is presented. The model is capable of calculating the response to changes in flow rate, fluid inlet temperature, and species concentration. The thermal response is based on a second-order model for each node, taking account of the thermal capacitance of the fluid and of the conduit inner wall. It is demonstrated that the model predicts a time delay, then a rapid initial response due to flow effects, followed by slower dynamics controlled by the thermal inertia of the walls. An intermodel comparison of output for a prototype duct is made with three published models, and an empirical validation is reported.},

Such effects have been shown to have an impact on peak temperatures and hence operation of heat pumps systems when short time scales are considered. A model has been developed that combines a two-dimensional numerical model and models of the pipe loop components. A novel heat exchanger analogy is employed to calculate the heat exchanger outlet temperatures such that iterative procedures can be avoided and numerical stability is unconditional. These approaches result in a model that is computationally efficient and captures much of the short timescale dynamic effects represented in fully three-dimensional models. This is demonstrated by comparison with experimental data and by comparing two and three-dimensional model behavior in the frequency domain. Predicted monthly outlet temperatures and heat transfer rates are furthermore shown to be in close agreement with experimental values and in good agreement with existing borehole heat exchanger models. The model is computationally efficient enough to allow use in routine analysis and design tasks.},

  abstract = {The modeling of the energy balance of buildings is a major task in building physics. In a new theory called dynamic thermal networks, developed at the Building Physics Research Group at Chalmers, the calculations are based on step- response functions, and the problems are illustrated in so-called dynamic networks. Long time scales for heat flux through building foundations and the surrounding ground are handled by a special reduction procedure.

The aim of this thesis is to apply the theory to increase knowledge of the factors that influence a dynamic heat loss calculation. The theory is used to illustrate the thermal behavior of different wall types, different foundations and whole buildings in three dimensions. The thermal behavior of a crawl space and an attic is studied, where the influence of long-wave radiation between internal surfaces is accounted for. A few applications of the theory on energy balances for problems having two or three boundary temperatures are presented, and an example of an application in a moisture problem is shown.

The step-response functions for one-dimensional cases are calculated analytically by using a combination of Fourier and Laplace techniques. The response functions for two- and three-dimensional cases are calculated numerically. Analytical expressions are fitted to the numerical values for short and long time to give better precision and faster calculation time.

The work reported in the thesis shows that it is fairly simple to apply the theory to heat balances. A building{\textquoteright}s heat balance can be calculated in a few minutes only for a time step of one hour during a year with an ordinary desktop computer. The full accuracy of the calculations for the three-dimensional step-response heat flow process in the building{\textquoteright}s envelope is essentially retained in the modeling during the annual cycle. The investigations of the thermal behavior of buildings and different building components show that a great deal of information can be gained from the response functions.},

  abstract  = {Despite the low energy consumption and lower maintenance benefits of ground-source heat pump (GSHP) systems, little work has been undertaken in detailed analysis and simulation of such systems. Long-term transient ground heat transfer significantly affects the performance of these systems. Annual and multi-year simulation consequently becomes an invaluable tool in the design of such systems---both in terms of calculating annual building loads and long-term ground thermal response. The EnergyPlus program, which makes use of variable time-step sizes in its simulation of building systems, was extended to allow multi-year simulations. Models of a water-source heat pump and a vertical borehole ground-loop heat exchanger have been implemented in Energy-Plus. The ground heat exchanger model uses Eskilson's {\textquotedblleft}g-functions{\textquotedblright} to model response to time-varying heat fluxes and has been extended to include a computationally efficient variable time-step load aggregation scheme. The performance of this model has been compared with an analytical line source approximation. For a steady periodic input that included pulsated heat extraction, the model agreed with the analytical solution to within 2{$^{\circ}$}C. The heat pump model was able to predict power and heat transfer rates over a wide range of operating conditions to within $\pm$10\% of published data. Experimental data from the Oklahoma State Hybrid Ground Source Heat Pump Laboratory have been used to validate both the heat pump and ground heat exchanger models. System simulation results were compared with five days of experimental data. The results showed an average error in the predicted ground heat transfer rate of less than 6\% and average errors in the predicted heat pump power and the predicted source-side heat transfer rate of less than 3\% and 4\%, respectively. Using these models, it is possible to represent GSHP systems in a flexible way and examine their performance over the extended periods required for proper analysis.},

  abstract = {The Drake Landing Solar Community in Okotoks, Alberta, Canada utilizes a solar thermal system with borehole seasonal storage to supply space heating to 52 detached energy-efficient homes through a district heating network. Systems of similar size and configuration have been constructed in Europe, however, this is the first system of this type designed to supply more than 90% of the space heating with solar energy and the first operating in such a cold climate (5200 degree C-days). Solar heat captured in 2293 m2 of flat-plate collectors, mounted on the roofs of detached garages, is stored in soil underground and later when needed for space heating, is extracted and distributed through a district system to each home in the subdivision. Independent solar domestic hot water systems installed on every house are designed to supply more than 50% of the water heating load. Annual greenhouse gas emission reductions from energy efficiency improvements and solar energy supply exceed 5 tonnes per house. The seasonal storage utilizes approximately 34,000 m3 of earth and a grid of 144 boreholes with single u-tube heat exchangers. The system is configured to maintain the centre of the field at the highest temperature to maximize heating capacity and the outer edges at the lowest temperature to minimize losses. A short -term thermal storage consisting of 240 m3 of water is used to interconnect the collection, distribution and seasonal heat storage subsystems. The system has undergone detailed monitoring since it was brought into service in July 2007 to characterize its performance and to improve the TRNSYS model employed in its design. A solar fraction of 97% in its fifth year of operation, convincingly confirms the design target, a solar fraction of more than 90% in year five, has been met. This paper describes the system and its operation, presents 5 years of measured performance and compares those results against the TRNSYS predicted performance for the same period.},

Heating and cooling loads are then converted into sine waves with an equivalent amplitude and the episodes determined from the change-point statistical analysis. Using the approximated equivalent sine waves, finite element or finite difference methods can be utilized to predict the long-term performance of the heat exchangers. The proposed methodology is compared to other existing approaches and showed better representation of the varying hourly ground thermal loads for a 1 year period. Moreover, a long-term thermal performance is predicted using the equivalent sine waves developed for balanced and unbalanced ground loads.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a finite line source model for vertical heat exchangers considering a layered soil profile. The existing analytical models assume a homogeneous soil profile, where the thermal properties of the ground along the entire length of the heat exchanger are uniform. This assumption can be unreliable since the typical length of heat exchangers is 60--100m (200--300ft.) and stratified ground is expected over this length. In the approach presented herein, the heat exchanger is divided into a number of segments to represent various soil layers along its length. Heat exchange induced temperature change at a certain location within the soil formation is evaluated by summing up the individual contributions of all these segments. The effect of the heat exchanger segment within the soil layer around itself is estimated using the finite line source model. Furthermore, the finite line source model is utilized on transformed sections for estimating the contributions of heat exchanger segments at locations outside their layer domains. The proposed model also incorporates two adjustments; the first accounts for the different heat rates within different soil layers while the second adjustment considers the heat exchange along the vertical direction between soil layers. Estimated results using the proposed model agree well with the results obtained from a calibrated finite element analysis. The proposed procedure is promising and can also be adapted within the framework of cylindrical models.},

New temperature response functions (G functions) are also presented for pile ground heat exchangers with spiral coils and for borehole ground heat exchangers with single or double U-shaped tubes. These temperature response functions can be used to analyze the impact of difference between properties of materials inside and outside boreholes or piles on the performance of ground heat exchangers. Theoretical results show that the difference in properties is an important factor affecting the temperature response of ground heat exchangers. Since the heat capacity of grout, inside boreholes, is fully considered by this line-source theory, the new G functions should be particularly suitable for predicting small-time dynamic behaviors of ground heat exchangers. Therefore, these G functions may be significant for energy analysis and in-situ thermal response tests of ground-coupled heat pump systems.},

The full-scale model is a composite expression consisting of a composite-medium line-source solution (inner solution), a finite line-source solution (outer solution), and an infinite line-source solution. The full-scale model is first verified by a frequency-decomposition method. Furthermore, the full-scale model is reformulated as a multi-stage model based on Duhamel{\textquoteright}s theorem to reduce the computational cost. The multi-stage model combines the three separate solutions in a sequential way, i.e., the inner solution for the short-time scale, the conventional infinite line-source solution for the intermediate time scale, and the outer solution for the long-time scale. Finally, we perform a parametric study on a ground heat exchanger with single U-shaped tube, by which the spacing between U-tube legs, the length-to-radius ratio of borehole, the ratios of thermal diffusivities and conductivities of the ground and backfilling material are analyzed.},

The technique is suitable for modelling long-term thermal interactions, although it suffers from a lack of accuracy in the short term. Alternatively, models based on the theory of thermal resistances and capacities provide a more accurate solution for the short term but at the cost of a long solution time that prevents an efficient iterative use. In this work, an artificial neural network designed to rapidly and accurately construct the short-term g-function of a ground heat exchanger is presented. To assemble a large training set, 15 000 simulations are performed with an accurate thermal resistance and capacity model. The boundary conditions used to solve the model allow direct construction of the short-term g-function for the outlet fluid temperature. A multilayer perceptron architecture is proposed in conjunction with a methodology designed to reduce training time and increase the accuracy of the neural network. The output of the resulting network is compared with numerical and experimental data sets.

Due to more recent thermal networks incorporating meshing decentralised heat and cold sources, the system often has to deal with variable temperatures and mass flow rates, with flow reversal occurring more frequently. This paper presents the mathematical derivation and software implementation in Modelica of a thermo-hydraulic model for thermal networks that meets the above requirements and compares it to both experimental data and a commonly used model. Good correspondence between experimental data from a controlled test set-up and simulations using the presented model was found. Compared to measurement data from a real district heating network, the simulation results led to a larger error than in the controlled test set-up, but the general trend is still approximated closely and the model yields results similar to a pipe model from the Modelica Standard Library. However, the presented model simulates 1.7 (for low number of volumes) to 68 (for highly discretized pipes) times faster than a conventional model for a realistic test case. A working implementation of the presented model is made openly available within the IBPSA Modelica Library. The model is robust in the sense that grid size and time step do not need to be adapted to the flow rate, as is the case in finite volume models.},

Moreover, the short-term response related to the dynamic behaviour of the GSHE is a crucial aspect, especially from a regulation criteria perspective in on/off controlled GSHP systems. In this context, a novel numerical GSHE model has been developed at the Instituto de Ingenier{\'{i}}a Energ{\'{e}}tica, Universitat Polit{\`{e}}cnica de Val{\`{e}}ncia. Based on the decoupling of the short-term and the long-term response of the GSHE, the novel model allows the use of faster and more precise models on both sides. In particular, the short-term model considered is the B2G model, developed and validated in previous research works conducted at the Instituto de Ingenier{\'{i}}a Energ{\'{e}}tica. For the long-term, the g-function model was selected, since it is a previously validated and widely used model, and presents some interesting features that are useful for its combination with the B2G model. The aim of the present paper is to describe the procedure of combining these two models in order to obtain a unique complete GSHE model for both short- and long-term simulation. The resulting model is then validated against experimental data from a real GSHP installation.},

  abstract = {The ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) have been extensively applied to commercial and residential buildings owing to their high-energy efficiencies and low running costs. The key component of the GSHP is a ground heat exchanger (GHE). The state-of-the-art two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) heat transfer models for borehole heat exchanger (BHE) and energy pile (EP) systems are reviewed in this paper. The physical procedures of heat transfer and the derivation of energy conservation within different channels of BHE (e.g., U-, W-, helical-shaped or coaxial-shaped) are summarized, in addition to the primary merits and demerits of each model. The main influencing factors on 2D and 3D model solutions including axial heat transfer, friction heat, spacing shack, thermal resistance, thermal short-circuiting between the inlet-pipe and outlet-pipe, are analysed and compared. Furthermore, various applications of these 2D and 3D models are elaborated. Finally, the recommendations, standpoints and potential future research on BHE heat transfer model are highlighted. It is believed that the work presented will contribute to the record of information and experiences necessary to develop BHEs for GSHP systems.},

This new formulation is nor sequential nor iterative, doesn't require use of Laplace or Fourier transform and provides a g-function by solving a single system of linear equations assembled in a block matrix system. A method to accelerate the integration of the finite-line source model based on Chebyshev polynomials is also introduced. Although it suffers from a fixed cost in terms of computational time, this approach allows to speed up the g-function assessment even further when used jointly with the block matrix formulation on large fields. By using both strategies, constructing the g-function of a ground heat exchanger composed of 50 regularly spaced boreholes can be achieved in less than half-second while committing only a small relative error. The speed and compactness of the block matrix formulation could be useful to design ground heat exchangers with optimization-based algorithms, which can require the assessment of several thousand g-functions.},

  abstract = {Models of ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems are used as an aid for the correct design and optimization of the system. For this purpose, it is necessary to develop models which correctly reproduce the dynamic thermal behavior of each component in a short-term basis. Since the borehole heat exchanger (BHE) is one of the main components, special attention should be paid to ensuring a good accuracy on the prediction of the short-term response of the boreholes. The BHE models found in literature which are suitable for short-term simulations usually present high computational costs. In this work, a novel TRNSYS type implementing a borehole-to-ground (B2G) model, developed for modeling the short-term dynamic performance of a BHE with low computational cost, is presented. The model has been validated against experimental data from a GSHP system located at Universitat Polit{\`{e}}cnica de Val{\`{e}}ncia, Spain. Validation results show the ability of the model to reproduce the short-term behavior of the borehole, both for a step-test and under normal operating conditions.},

In this paper, a new analytical g-function is proposed to account for the effect of borehole heat capacity (BHC) on ground thermal response; and the quantitative effect of BHC on ground and fluid temperature can be obtained by the new g-function without needing transient borehole resistance. Firstly, a cylindrical source model considering BHC effect was built to conduct the new g-function by Laplace transform method. Then, the fluid temperature models coupling with the proposed g-function were built to investigate the effect of BHC fluid temperature. By comparing new model with conventional g-functions, it was found that the new g-function agreed better with the experimental data than the conventional models during short time. The largest relative error for ground temperature prediction for U pipe GHE was about 2.9% and the mean relative error for fluid temperature prediction in coaxial GHE was less than 1%. Moreover, it was found that the BHC had an especially significant influence on ground thermal response and fluid temperature at short times and the influence weakened with time. And the larger the BHC was, the smaller the influence radius would be.},

This makes BTES of special interest to many industries. However, post-implementation evaluations of large-scale industrial BTES are scarce. The BTES at Xylem{\textquoteright}s production plant in Emmaboda, Sweden is one of the world{\textquoteright}s largest BTES systems for storage of industrial excess heat. In this paper, the BTES at Emmaboda was evaluated with respect to how it was integrated and how it has performed during its first seven years of operation. The BTES consists of 140 boreholes, 150 m deep, and heat for storage is mainly recovered from two high-temperature ovens and the foundry ventilation air. So far, the highest heat extraction and BTES efficiency (19%) took place in the storage system{\textquoteright}s sixth full year of operation, when roughly 2200 MWh and 400 MWh were injected into and extracted from the storage respectively. One main reason extraction is not higher is that the quantities and/or the quality of the excess heat for storage are lower than estimated, thus hindering the storage from reaching the necessary temperatures for heat extraction.},

In order to increase the flexibility, several analytical models were recently proposed and the model of Cimmino and Bernier is the most precise of such models. In their approach, they split each borehole into segments where they assume an unknown constant heat flux. In this paper, we modify their approach where we replace the piecewise-constant heat flux profile assumption by a piecewise-linear distribution. Doing so, it is possible to achieve the same precision with fewer segments in the model. The model needs however a new mathematical treatment of the thermal response which is developed in the present paper. Comparison between both approaches and original Eskison g-function is done.},

  abstract = {Vertical BHE (borehole heat exchangers) are a common solution for GCHP applications (ground coupled heat pump). Correct BHE design and sizing are mandatory to either assure long term GCHP performance or reduce the payback period. Most models for performing the time varying analysis of complex borefields are based on the solution of the conduction equation, through the calculation of proper temperature response factors. The DST (Duct Storage Model) is often referred as the benchmark analysis tool, even if it is based on a simplified description of the borefield geometry. In this paper, DST predictions, in terms of hourly fluid temperatures along 20 years, are compared with the corresponding results obtained by implementing the MLAA (Multiple Aggregation Algorithm) approach by Bernier et{~}al. into a model able to employ suitable g-functions generated starting from the Finite Line Source solution. This paper discusses some aspects of the improvements here introduced to the original MLAA method. The study is devoted to the comparison between the predicted fluid temperature values by the DST and MLAA models, with special attention to the influence of the BHE geometry (matrix like vs in line configurations) and to the shape of the yearly hourly load profiles (balanced vs unbalanced ground loads).},

In order to evaluate the fluid temperature in the borehole of a geothermal heat pump system, most of the current models express the heat transfer rate as a sum of step changes in heat transfer rate. The borehole temperature is then computed as a superposition of the different contributions of each time step. The main difference between the different models lies in the way the step response is computed. Since all these methods are based on a convolution scheme, long time simulations are very time consuming. Many load aggregation algorithms have been proposed in order to reduce this computational time. In a previous paper we proposed a new algorithm to evaluate the overall response which was much faster than the classical aggregation schemes. However this new algorithm was based on the cylindrical source step response for a single borehole. In this paper, we present a generalization of this scheme for any kind of step response making it a very powerful tool for hourly simulations.},

In this paper, a thermal response factors, $\delta$-function is proposed for computing fluid and ground temperatures of borehole fields. $\delta$-function is a non-dimensional ground temperature response and an accurate analytical solution of finite line source model to a unit rectangular heat pulse. Numerical computation of $\delta$-function is quite fast for its small integral range. The accuracy of $\delta$-function is validated by the simulation results of g-function. The comparative computations are conducted for the hourly simulation of various long periods by combining the g- and $\delta$-functions with both time and spectral domain methods. It is found that the combination of $\delta$-function with fast Fourier transform (FFT) provides dramatically fast computing speed. Therefore, the computation approach of $\delta$-function combined with FFT is the most suitable to quickly and accurately compute the fluid and ground temperatures in parameterized design and long-term simulation of vertical GHE and GCHP systems.},

The substitution of ground nodes with short and long-term g-functions allows the simulation with short time steps keeping the possibility of simulating periods of several years. A complete analysis of the influence of characteristic parameters of the model in terms of the heat conduction path, vertical discretization level and equivalent heat capacity, has been carried out. The model shows a good performance for short simulation time-steps of five minutes for the prediction of both the short-term and long-term response.

In this approach, the use of simplified thermal resistance and capacity models (TRCMs) provides accurate results while substantially reducing the number of nodes and the computation time compared with fully discretized computations such as finite element (FE) models. The model is compared with a fully discretized FE model which serves as a reference. Furthermore, the model is used to evaluate thermal response test (TRT) data by the parameter estimation technique. Comparison of the model results with the results of an analytical model based on the line-source theory further establishes the advantage of the developed 3D transient model, as the test duration can be shortened and results are more accurate.},

The solutions are formulated for two types of boundary conditions: a time-dependent Neumann boundary condition, and a time-dependent Dirichlet boundary condition. We solve the initial and boundary value problem for a single heat source using the modified Bessel function, for the spatial domain, and the fast Fourier transform, for the temporal domain. For multiple heat sources, we apply directly the superposition principle for the Neumann boundary condition, but for the Dirichlet boundary condition, we conduct an analytical coupling, which allows for the exact thermal interaction between all involved heat sources. The heat sources can exhibit different time-dependent signals, and can have any distribution in space. The solutions are verified against the analytical solution given by Carslaw and Jaeger for a constant Neumann boundary condition, and the finite element solution for both types of boundary conditions. Compared to these two solutions, the proposed solutions are exact at all radial distances, highly elegant, robust and easy to implement.},

  abstract = {Ground source heat pump systems often use closed-loop heat exchangers, which depend on the soil thermal conductivity and borehole thermal resistance as parameters. An in-situ thermal response test provides a method to estimate these two parameters. In analyzing the in-situ test, one commonly uses the mean of the measured inlet and outlet temperatures of the circulating fluid as a representative fluid temperature along the entire ground loop. This assumption is convenient but not rigorous. In this paper an analytical model of the actual vertical temperature profile in the ground loop has been developed for the late-time period of the in-situ test. With this model one can estimate the soil thermal conductivity and borehole thermal resistance without the mean temperature approximation. In addition, the model identifies dimensionless groups that guide a sensitivity study of the errors introduced by the mean temperature approximation. The error in the total thermal resistance is less than 5% if the volume flow rate is maintained above a threshold, which increases linearly with the total length of the borehole. The analysis also indicates a p-linear averaging method gives smaller errors than the mean temperature approximation.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the thermal response of bore fields using the concept of g-functions introduced by Eskilson. In the first part of the paper, the original concept of the g-functions is reviewed. Then, a new method is proposed to approximate the g-functions. The method accounts for the variation of heat extraction rates among boreholes due to thermal interaction among boreholes and for the buried depth to borehole height ratio (D/H) which was not included in Eskilson's original work. The new method is based on the analytical finite line source and the solution is not limited to regular borehole spacing. Borehole-to-borehole and group-to-borehole response factors are evaluated and then temporal superposition of heat extraction rates is applied in the Laplace domain. The heat extraction rates obtained with the proposed method showed good agreement with Eskilson's numerical model. The differences observed can be explained by the fact that two different boundary conditions are used at the borehole wall. However, for small simulation times, the differences are small and the response factors are almost identical for up to 10 and 6 years for 3{~}$\times${~}2 and 10{~}$\times${~}10 bore fields, respectively. For large bore fields, thermal interactions among boreholes become important and the differences observed between the proposed model and the g-function increase. For instance, the g-function of a 10{~}$\times${~}10 bore field obtained with the proposed method overestimates the g-function by 32% at steady-state. Finally, the effect of the buried depth (D) is examined using the proposed method. It is shown that the response factor of a 5{~}m borehole buried at depths of 1 and 3{~}m differ by 19%.},

  abstract  = {The correct design and optimization of complex energy systems requires the ability to reproduce the dynamic thermal behavior of each system component. In ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems, modelling the borehole heat exchangers (BHE) dynamic response is especially relevant in the development of control strategies for energy optimization purposes. Over the last years, several models have been developed but most of them are based on steady- state approaches, which makes them unsuitable for short-term simulation purposes. In fact, in order to accurately predict the evolution of the fluid temperatures due to the ON/OFF cycles of the heat pump, it is essential to correctly characterize the dynamic response of BHE for very short time periods. The aim of the present paper is to compare the performance of an analytical steady-state model, available in TRNSYS environment (Type 557), with a novel short-term dynamic model. The new dynamic model is based on the thermal-network approach coupled with a vertical discretization of the borehole which takes into account both the advection due to the fluid circulating along the U-tube, and the heat transfer in the borehole and in the ground. These two approaches were compared against experimental data collected from a real GSHP system installed at the Universitat Politecnica de Valencia. The analysis was performed comparing the outlet temperature profiles predicted by both models during daily standard ON/OFF operating conditions, both in heating and cooling mode, and the between both approaches were highlighted. Finally, the obtained results have been discussed focusing on the potential impact that the differences found in the prediction of the temperature evolution could have in design and optimization of GSHP systems.},

In particular, the method allows to calculate how the heat is distributed among the borehole heat exchangers in the field according to the way the brine is supplied to the borehole heat storage system. This enables to test the same borehole field configuration pattern for different piping arrangement. An example of application where a simultaneous need of heating and cooling is met by extracting and injecting heat in different region of the ground storage is considered to illustrate the potential of the method.},

The speed in computing this function is critical for the applicability of the method.

  abstract = {In the modeling of shallow geothermal systems, the accurate representation of the borehole field configuration is important for a proper estimation of the long term thermal behavior of borehole field systems. Modeling tools based on the so-called g-functions method, utilized for the design of borehole fields, assume that boreholes are vertical. This is a limitation since this condition might not apply in a real installation. This paper is focused on the calculation of g-functions of borehole fields featuring non-vertical boreholes. The strategy utilized consists in representing the boreholes as stacked finite line sources. The temperature along these finite lines, can be calculated by superposition of the effects of each linear heat source in the field. This modeling technique allows to approximate uneven heat distribution among the boreholes and along the axis of each individual borehole. This is a required feature for the calculation of g-functions according to Eskilson's boundary conditions. The test cases presented show that the method yields results that are compatible with the expected physical behavior of the system, and similar to previous results by Eskilson. The computational performance achieved indicates that the method proposed could be potentially utilized during the design phase of these systems.},

One popular method to estimate the thermal parameters is the interpretation of in situ thermal response tests. The modeled response is Tm=(Tin+Tout)/2, the average temperature of the fluid entering and leaving the ground. The Tm response corresponds to the physically unrealistic hypothesis of constant heat flux along a borehole. Using a 3D finite element model of the borehole, we show that Tm does not correspond to the fluid mean temperature within the borehole. Accordingly, with Tm, an overestimation of the borehole thermal resistance results. The resistance overestimation has a noticeable economic impact. We propose instead a new estimator we name “p-linear” average of Tin and Tout with parameter p→-1, as determined by numerical simulations. We show that the p-linear average closely fits the average fluid temperature computed with the numerical model, hence avoiding bias in estimation of borehole thermal resistance. Finally, we discuss the problem of collinearity arising in the estimation of thermal parameters.},

  abstract = {Geothermal boreholes have been used for many years to extract and store thermal energy. For a long time, the behavior of such systems was studied using analytical and numerical models, but the configurations were mostly limited to one inlet and one outlet per bore field. In recent years, some interest has been given to more complex bore field systems, in which heat can be shared between suppliers and customers. This paper is concerned with a system that shares energy through two independent loops within the same borehole. In the literature, a model was recently found to study the heat transfer in this type of arrangement, but it is limited to a symmetric configuration. This paper broadens the method to non-symmetric borehole configurations. A comparison is made between the performance of an optimum configuration and a symmetric one. In one application, with two heat pumps, one in cooling mode and one in heating mode, as much as 3.5% improvement was observed between both configurations. However, in our second application, where a detailed hourly simulation coupling residential heat pumps and solar collectors to the same bore field is presented, the non-symmetric configuration energy consumption of the heat pumps gave comparable results to the symmetric configuration. Further analysis would be needed to evaluate the full impact of all the parameters on the final performance of independent loops.},

To account for time-varying heat flux, the temporal superposition principle is used and expressed as a convolution product, and then solved with a fast Fourier transform to significantly cut down the computation time. It is shown that the proposed algorithm is fast and accurate.},

  abstract = {Dispersion coefficients for turbulent flow are commonly available, but the common models are not easily implemented for fast computation of dispersion in time-dependent large flow systems. Criteria were developed to aid in the choice of parameters for a model combining plug flow with the N-continuously stirred-tanks model to obtain the best agreement with the pure axial-dispersed plug-flow model, while simultaneously being computationally efficient. Solution accuracy and computational savings were demonstrated for a realistic food industry example. The proposed model includes a method of structuring the discretisation to handle the simulation of pressure drop and momentum balance simultaneously with simulation of dispersion. The criteria were derived from the analysis of Laplace transforms. It was also shown that the proposed model predicts the response to a step change in concentration in agreement with the exact solution of the axial-dispersed plug-flow model. The model was written in the object-oriented language Modelica as an object in a library structure which is being developed to simulate complex liquid food process lines and their control systems.},

  abstract = {When designing ground source heat pump systems in northern regions, we usually face the problem of soil freezing/melting around ground heat exchanger. The impact of freezing on heat transfer should be evaluated. An improved thermal resistance and capacity model based on the effective heat capacity method is developed in the paper to evaluate the effect. Further comparisons have been carried out against measured data from an experimental set-up, and agreement of the results validates the proposed model when the parameters of the model are set properly. The heat transfer capacity could rise by 30% because of phase change. The quantity of heat transfer could stay at 75 W/m to 80 W/m during three-month operation, which is feasible for a GSHP system to operate normally in such extreme condition.},

  abstract = {Ground-coupled heat pumps are increasingly being utilized to heat and cool buildings. Although it is difficult to size and to predict their behavior and performance, their design can be optimized via simulations. EnergyPlus is a popular energy simulation program for modeling building heating and other energy flows and, since it is organized to consider borehole heat exchangers via the well-known g-functions approach, it can be used advantageously for that purpose. The Capacity Resistance Model is another recent numerical simulation tool devoted to ground and borehole heat exchangers. In this work, two methods to calculate the g-fucntions were analyzed, using as case-study a real office building, whose imbalance between the heat extracted and injected into the ground was found to be appreciable. The energy imbalance involves a ground temperature drift affecting the system efficiency. The results of the EnergyPlus g-functions and the Capacity Resistance Model model approaches were compared. The capacity of the two methodologies to accurately simulate this phenomenon were analysed also with reference to the available building's long-term monitoring data. The analysis showed the importance of using g-functions suitable to reflect the layout of the borehole field, in order to correctly evaluate the energy performance of the entire ground source heat pump system.<br/> Copyright &copy; 2018 ASHRAE.},

  abstract = {Structural foundation piles are being used increasingly as heat exchangers to provide renewable heat for new buildings. To design such energy systems a steady state is assumed within the pile, which is conventionally characterised by constant thermal resistance. However, there has been little research regarding pile resistance and there are few published case studies. Numerical modelling results are presented here to provide typical values of pile resistance, depending on the details of the heat exchange pipes. Analysis suggests large diameter piles may take several days to reach steady state; in these cases a transient design approach may be more appropriate.},

  abstract = {Foundation piles used as heat exchangers as part of a ground energy system have the potential to reduce energy use and carbon dioxide emissions from new buildings. However, current design approaches for pile heat exchangers are based on methods developed for boreholes which have a different geometry, with a much larger aspect (length to diameter) ratio. Current methods also neglect the transient behaviour of the pile concrete, instead assuming a steady state resistance for design purposes. As piles have a much larger volume of concrete than boreholes, this neglects the significant potential for heat storage within the pile. To overcome these shortcomings this paper presents new pile temperature response functions (G-functions) which are designed to reflect typical geometries of pile heat exchangers and include the transient response of the pile concrete. Owing to the larger number of pile sizes and pipe configurations which are possible with pile heat exchangers it is not feasible to developed a single unified G-function and instead upper and lower bound solutions are provided for different aspects ratios.},
